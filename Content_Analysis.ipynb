A steady weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week is recommended for the most effective long-term weight management. That said, many eating plans leave you feeling hungry or unsatisfied. These are major reasons why you might find it hard to stick to a healthier eating plan.\n",

        "One way to lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. This could be with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains.\n",

        "When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally end up eating fewer calories (1).\n",

        "Drink coffee or tea. Caffeine consumption can boost your metabolism (24Trusted Source, 25).\n",
        "Base your diet on whole foods. They’re healthier, more filling, and much less likely to cause overeating than processed foods.\n",
        "Eat slowly. Eating quickly can lead to weight gain over time, while eating slowly makes you feel more full and boosts weight-reducing hormones (26Trusted Source).\n",
