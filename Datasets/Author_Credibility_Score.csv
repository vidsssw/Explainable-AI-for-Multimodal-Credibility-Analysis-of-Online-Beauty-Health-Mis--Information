A steady weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week is recommended for the most effective long-term weight management. That said, many eating plans leave you feeling hungry or unsatisfied. These are major reasons why you might find it hard to stick to a healthier eating plan. However, not all diets have this effect. Low carb diets and whole food, lower calorie diets are effective for weight loss and may be easier to stick to than other diets.Here are some ways to lose weight that employ healthy eating, potentially lower carbs, and that aim to:One way to lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. This could be with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains.When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally end up eating fewer calories (1).With a low carb eating plan, you’ll utilize burning stored fat for energy instead of carbs. If you choose to eat more complex carbs like whole grains along with a calorie deficit, you’ll benefit from higher fiber and digest them more slowly. This makes them more filling to keep you satisfied.A 2020 study confirmed that a very low carbohydrate diet was beneficial for losing weight in older populations (2). Research also suggests that a low carb diet can reduce appetite, which may lead to eating fewer calories without thinking about it or feeling hungry (3).Note that the long-term effects of a low carb diet are still being researched. It can also be difficult to adhere to a low carb diet, which may lead to yo-yo dieting and less success in maintaining a healthy weight.There are potential downsides to a low carb diet that may lead you to a different method. Reduced calorie diets can also lead to weight loss and be easier to maintain for longer periods of time.If you opt for a diet focusing instead on whole grains over refined carbs, a 2019 study correlated high whole grain with lower body mass index (BMI) (4).To determine the best way for you to lose weight, consult your doctor for recommendations. Reducing sugars and starches, or carbs, from your diet can help curb your appetite, lower your insulin levels, and make you lose weight. But the long-term effects of a low carb diet are not yet known. A reduced calorie diet could be more sustainable.Each one of your meals should include:To see how you can assemble your meals, check out:Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight (5). Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight, (6, 7, 8). Here’s how to determine how much you need to eat without eating too much. Many factors determine your specific needs, but generally, an average person needs (9):Diets with adequate protein can also help:In one study, people on a higher protein diet ate 441 fewer calories per day (10, 11).Don’t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They’re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.Don’t be afraid of eating fats. Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan.Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content (12).Assemble each meal out of a protein source, healthy fat source, complex carb, and vegetables. Leafy green vegetables are a great way to bulk up a meal with low calories and lots of nutrients. Exercise, while not required to lose weight, can help you lose weight more quickly. Lifting weights has particularly good benefits.By lifting weights, you’ll burn lots of calories and prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight (13, 14, 15). Try going to the gym three to four times a week to lift weights. If you’re new to the gym, ask a trainer for some advice. Make sure your doctor is also aware of any new exercise plans.If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming is very beneficial for weight loss and general health. Both cardio and weightlifting can help with weight loss.Resistance training, such as weightlifting, is a great option for losing weight. If that’s not possible, cardio workouts are also effective. Choose what’s sustainable for you.If you opt for a low carb eating plan, it’s not necessary to count calories as long as you keep your carb intake very low and stick to protein, fat, and low carb vegetables.If you find yourself not losing weight, you may want to keep track of your calories to see if that’s a contributing factor.If you’re sticking to a calorie deficit to lose weight, you can use a free online calculator like this one. Enter your sex, weight, height, and activity levels. The calculator will tell you how many calories to eat per day to maintain your weight, lose weight, or lose weight fast. You can also download free, easy-to-use calorie counters from websites and app stores. Here’s a list of 5 calorie counters to try.Note that eating too few calories can be dangerous and less effective for losing weight. Aim to reduce your calories by a sustainable and healthy amount based on your doctor’s recommendation.Counting calories isn’t usually needed to lose weight on a low carb eating plan. But if you’re not losing weight or on a reduced calorie eating plan, calorie counting may help.Here are 9 more tips to lose weight faster:For more tips on weight loss, read about natural tips for losing weight here.Eating whole foods, higher protein, soluble fiber, and less sugar can help you lose more weight. Don’t forget to get a good night’s sleep, too.These sample meal plans are low carb, which limits carbs to 20–50 carbs per day. Each meal should have protein, healthy fats, and veggies.If you’d prefer to lose weight while still eating complex carbs, add in some healthy whole grains such as:You may lose 5–10 pounds (2.3–4.5 kg) of weight — sometimes more — in the first week of a diet plan and then lose weight consistently after that. The first week is usually a loss of both body fat and water weight.If you’re new to dieting, weight loss may happen more quickly. The more weight you have to lose, the faster you’ll lose it. Unless your doctor suggests otherwise, losing 1–2 pounds per week is usually a safe amount. If you’re trying to lose weight faster than that, speak to your doctor about a safe level of calorie reduction. Aside from weight loss, a low carb diet can improve your health in a few ways, though the long-term effects are not yet known:Other diet types that reduce calories and increase whole foods are also associated with improved metabolic markers and slower aging (34, 35, 36). Ultimately, you may find a more balanced diet that includes complex carbohydrates is more sustainable. Significant weight can be lost on a low carb or low calorie diet, but the speed depends on the individual. General weight loss can improve certain markers of health, such as blood sugar and cholesterol levels.By reducing carbs or replacing refined carbs with complex carbs, you’ll likely experience reduced appetite and hunger. This removes the main reasons it’s often difficult to maintain a weight loss plan. With a sustainable low carb or lower calorie eating plan, you can eat healthy food until you’re full and still lose a significant amount of fat. The initial drop in water weight can lead to a drop in the scales within a few days. Fat loss takes longer.Read this article in Spanish.

How to Lose Weight in 10 Days: Expert Tips And A 10-Day Diet Plan
Weight Loss: We are all guilty of trying all sorts of diets and fitness tips to lose those extra pounds.HighlightsWe are all guilty of trying all sorts of diets and fitness tipsDon't weigh yourself daily, sometimes it just unecessarily panics youFor next 10 days try to eat maximum meals at home
Weight Loss:If you are trying to lose weight gained during the holidays or to fit back into your bathing suit for the summer, or simply to lead a healthier lifestyle, you know it is a task that needs time and patience. We are all guilty of trying all sorts of diets and fitness tips to lose those extra pounds. While some have been successful in meeting their goals adopting extreme measures, others have struggled and struggled to a point that have made them give up hope. The truth is that losing weight is easy, but only if done in the right manner. You cannot give up midway for lack of instant results. So here are my top 10 secrets to help you achieve your target weight this year, and not just that, these daily practices would also help you lead a healthier life. Top 10 tips to reboot your body and kick start weight loss1. Start Your Day With A WorkoutSet up your alarm 20 minutes early and schedule your workout first thing in the morning. Studies suggest that people who exercise in the morning are relatively slimmer and healthier than the ones who exercise later in the day. Carry the feel good hormones and energy throughout the day by doing your exercise in the morning. 2. Skip the ScaleDon't weigh yourself daily, sometimes it just unnecessarily panics you and can be demotivating. Also, the scale can be deceiving as it ignores the fact that you might be adding muscle weight. Weigh yourself once a week and ideally in the morning. 3. Carry Your Own SnacksWhen I consult clients I have realised that their main meals are well managed, however, snack is an area where most of them end up going for unnecessary foods and jeopardise their weight loss. It's a great idea to pack your own snack at work or on the go. Make small packs of nuts and seeds, fruits, plain yogurt, chaach, sprouts, dark chocolate, chilla, cubes of paneer or cheese. 4. Eat An AppleThis one is my favorite, and I tell most of my clients """"eat an apple or visualise it. If you are not hungry enough to eat one full apple, you are not hungry, just bored!"""". Engage in fun activities or hobbies like singing, reading or whatever you fancy. Thinking about food all the time can be extremely taxing for your weight loss efforts.5. Try To Eat Meals At HomeFor the next 10 days try to eat maximum meals at home. This gives you complete control over ingredients like sugar, fat, oil and salt that goes into your food. You will be surprised how fast you will lose all that extra flab by just doing this.6. Become a Water BabyGo for a swim and up your fluid intake, drink loads of water and green vegetable juices. Every season offers us an abundance of water-rich fruits; in summers you have fruits like melons, in the winter months go for amla-water or warm nimbu-paani. Go for the incredible summer fruits and vegetables that are 96% water. In fact a study showed how 14 men and women increased their metabolic rate by 30% by just increasing their water intake on a daily basis.7. Eat SlowlyWe all know this, but now put it in practice. You will be surprised how your portions will reduce and your food will be absorbed better. Eat in a state of complete relaxation for optimum absorption and digestion.8. Eat ProteinIncrease yourprotein intake as it helps burn fat, and build muscle. Eat cheese, eggs, sprouts, lentils chicken, fish or meat. Also, protein keeps you full as your body takes time to digest protein, hence you are satiated. 9. Don't Stock Unhealthy Food at HomeIt is impossible to resist temptation if it is sitting on your kitchen shelf. Don't get evil foods, don't eat evil food. No one in your family needs processed, unhealthy, packaged food. The only way to work around it is to not buy them.10. Think About Your Ideal WeightImagine yourself at your dream weight. Visualise wearing an outfit you have dreamt of, and see yourself slim. Everything in existence has begun with the right thought. Positively reinforce and tell yourself """"I will achieve xyz weight in 10 days, don't doubt your thought. Give it the right energy, and see yourself happy and leaner not just in thought but in reality.

4,https://www.livestrong.com/article/79644-lose-weight-days-exercise/,"While it's possible to lose weight by changing your diet without exercising, you'll lose weight more quickly if your weight-loss plan includes diet and exercise, according to a study published in Obesity in 2012. The key to losing weight is to eat fewer calories than you burn during the day. You shouldn't expect to lose very much in just one week, especially if you're trying to lose weight through dieting alone. Aim for weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds weekly.Each pound of fat contains about 3,500 calories, so eating 500 to 1,000 calories fewer than what is required to maintain your current weight will help you lose about 1 to 2 pounds per week. If you're a man, you need between 14 and 18 calories per pound to maintain your weight, depending on how active you are, and if you're a woman, you need between 12 and 16 calories per pound. Thus, a man who weighs 180 pounds and is sedentary needs about 2,520 calories per day to maintain his weight and about 2,020 calories per day to lose about 1 pound per week. A sedentary woman of the same weight needs about 2,160 calories to maintain her weight and 1,660 calories per day to lose about 1 pound per week.You shouldn't try to lose more weight than that safe 1 to 2 pounds a week using diet alone, as eating too few calories can slow down your metabolism and make it even more difficult to lose weight. Men need to eat at least 1,800 calories per day, and women need to eat a minimum of 1,500 calories per day to prevent this potential decrease in metabolism.If you eat too much of the wrong types of foods while trying to cut calories, you may have trouble sticking to your diet, because you'll feel hungry; alternatively, you may end up not getting enough of the essential nutrients. When you're not trying to lose weight, you still want to eat plenty of vegetables, fruits and lean protein foods, so limit the amount of highly processed foods, fatty foods, sweets and refined grains that you eat.Protein is particularly important to include in each meal and snack, as it helps you limit muscle loss and increase satiety. Aim for between 25 and 30 grams of protein in each meal, recommends a review article published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2015. It isn't difficult to reach this goal. For example, a 3-ounce serving of salmon and a glass of skim milk provide a total of 30 grams of protein. You can also meet this recommendation by eating a cup of cooked lentils and an ounce of peanuts or a 3-ounce serving of turkey breast.Protein isn't the only important nutrient; however, you also need carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and minerals. One way to get a good mix of essential nutrients is to divide your plate equally between your protein choice, whole grains, vegetables and fruits. If you have time for more involved meal planning, you can follow the diet composition for weight loss recommended by the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. Throughout the day, your diet should consist of about 30 percent protein, 25 percent fat and 45 percent carbohydrates. For a 1,500-calorie diet, this means about 112 grams of protein, 42 grams of fat and 75 grams of carbs per day; for a 2,100-calorie diet, this translates to about 158 grams of protein, 58 grams of fat and 236 grams of carbs per dayAmericans get a lot of calories each day from their beverages, but drinks aren't as filling as solid foods. It's better to choose non-caloric or low-calorie beverage options; among the better choices for weight loss include black coffee, tea without any sweeteners and water, which all may potentially increase weight loss. For example, drinking about 16 ounces of water before each meal as part of a low-calorie diet helped people lose more weight than following a low-calorie diet alone, reports a study published in Obesity in 2011.Skip sugar-sweetened beverages, and don't add cream, whipped cream, flavor syrups or caloric sweeteners to your coffee or tea. Simple switches can make a big difference. A 12-ounce regular ginger ale has about 124 calories, so choosing seltzer water with a 2-ounce splash of 100-percent orange juice saves 94 calories.Although it isn't healthy to lose a large amount of weight in one week, minimizing any extra water weight you may be carrying may help you look a bit thinner. Limiting the amount of sodium you consume and getting a sufficient amount of potassium to balance out the sodium you do consume can help reduce water weight gain and bloating. While it may sound counterintuitive, drinking plenty of water can also have this effect. If you're dehydrated, your body will hold onto extra water until you're properly rehydrated again. Skip alcohol as well, because it can first act as a diuretic to dehydrate you and then cause your body to retain more water to fix this problem.

We know how important making choices about your overall health is, and we                strive to provide you with the best information possible.Everyone knows the popular weight-loss mantra: Move more and eat less. And although they're listed together, these two pieces of advice don't need to be treated equally. In fact, it is possible to lose weight without exercise. Let us explain.First thing's first: we are not denying that moderate-intensity exercise is good for maintaining and improving your health; however, dozens of studies have uncovered evidence that exercise alone may not be the best way to lose weight.Many weight-loss strategies suggest that the more you work out, the more calories you'll burn, and the more you'll lose weight. But a recent study published in Current Biology found that this may not necessarily be true. The researchers discovered that once you start working out regularly, your body may end up adapting to this new level of activity. As a result, your body may end up lowering the total number of calories it needs.""There is tons of evidence that exercise is important for keeping our bodies and minds healthy, and this work does nothing to change that message,"" one of the study's authors, Professor Herman Pontzer of City University of New York, told The Guardian. ""What our work adds is that we also need to focus on diet, particularly when it comes to managing our weight and preventing or reversing unhealthy weight gain.""Even more research shows exercise can undermine weight loss by making you hungrier and it can mislead you into thinking it's ok to indulge in junk foods either as a reward for exercising or because you've created a calorie deficit. One Obesity Reviews study even found that people tend to overestimate how many calories they burn when they workout. As a result, participants typically overcompensated for their workouts by eating more calories than they burned.Although exercise can certainly help build fat-burning muscle, it may not shrink your waistline as much as changing your diet will.So now that we know ""eating less"" should take priority in your weight-loss journey, where to start? Because it's easier said than done, we've uncovered some slimming secrets that can help you drop pounds through diet swaps as well as lifestyle and eating habit changes. (And yes, de-stressing with a bubble bath is one of them.) Read on to find out how to lose weight fast without exercise, and for more on how to eat healthy, you won't want to miss these 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.Want to eat less? Your first line of defense is getting a good night's rest. When you don't get enough quality shut-eye, your body increases levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and decreases the satiety hormone leptin—resulting in unignorable hunger pangs. Plus, studies show that your sleep-deprived self craves more unhealthy, high-calorie and high-fat foods, which means you'll not only eat more food, but you'll be eating more junk. For more ways to lose weight at night, read up—then ditch—these nighttime habits that cause weight gain.RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!Over 50 percent of Americans drink coffee on a regular basis, and many of them use calorie-laden additives like sugar, flavored syrups, or cream in their beverage. As a result, rather than being a zero or five calorie drink, the average calorie count of a cuppa joe skyrockets 1,280 percent, to 69 calories, according to a recent study published in the journal Public Health. Not only will taking your coffee black save you nearly 500 calories a week, but, since more than 60 percent of those calories come from sugar, you'll also be lowering your risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Leaving the sugar packets on the shelf is one of our easy ways to cut calories.
Did you know that 60 percent of the time we inappropriately respond to thirst by eating instead of drinking? So says a study in the journal Physiology & Behavior. Experts believe the mistake stems from the fact that the same part of our brain controls hunger and thirst, and sometimes it mixes up the signals. Not only will keeping a water bottle around help you respond to thirst correctly, but chugging water can help you feel full, keep your metabolism humming, and even help you debloat!
Vegetable oils like canola and soybean oil are high in inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, which can throw your body into a state of chronic inflammation, causing weight gain and skin issues. Instead, grab a bottle of extra virgin olive oil, whose polyphenols have been known to help lower blood pressure and whose oleic acid has been found to help reduce appetite and promote weight loss.
Dairy fat, that is. You may be surprised to hear it, but fat-free food doesn't necessarily translate to a fat-free body; According to a European Journal of Nutrition study, participants who ate full-fat dairy tended to weigh less and gained less weight over time than those who opted for non-fat products. Experts explain that non-fat foods can be less satisfying overall thanks to the low fat content (since fats are digested slowly and can keep you fuller longer), and because many fat-free food items are made with waist-widening artificial ingredients.
Don't push through that mid-afternoon grumble. Trust us. Studies have found that those who eat late lunches, and those who go the most time in between meals end up consuming more calories during those meals compared to those who eat more often. The reasoning is simple: when you're hungry—and running on empty—your body switches to starvation mode and increases production of your hunger hormones, which then causes you to overcompensate at your next meal. To keep yourself from overeating, always carry a snack with you.
The junk food struggle is real—we know. And willpower isn't to blame. A University of Sydney study found that eating junk food can become a habit and one that's perpetuated simply by stepping into a room (like your kitchen) or experiencing a food cue (like a fast food commercial). Breaking these bad eating habits will take time and patience, but there's a simple fix: Prioritize healthy foods in front of junk food in your pantry. That way, when you're craving a cookie you have to push aside the almonds and quinoa to get to it. It'll serve as a little reminder to keep up your better-body goals.
Fill up on veggies and you'll be less likely to fill out your jeans. Research published in the journal PLOS Medicine linked greater consumption of high-fiber vegetables to greater weight-loss results when compared with diets low in high-fiber foods. Not only are these veggies super-satiating, they're also full of anti-inflammatory antioxidants and will displace snacks like nutrient-deficient potato chips and pretzels.
You don't have to go all-out vegan to reap the benefits of a meat-free diet. Just try for one lunch or dinner a week to lose weight without exercise. In doing so, you'll be consuming more plant-based protein, of which a University of Copenhagen study found to be even more satisfying than pork and veal-based meals, and make people feel more full. It gets better: The researchers also found that participants who ate a vegetarian high-protein meal consumed 12 percent fewer calories in their next meal compared to those who ate meat!
You have two options when you get home late from work starving and see an empty fridge—one, order belly-bloating, high-calorie, greasy takeout, or two, whip up a quick veggie-packed stir fry with the frozen veggies you always keep in your freezer. If you keep healthy ingredients on hand (like frozen fruits, veggies, and pre-portioned protein), you won't have to resort to unhealthy delivery meals. For tips on what you should stock in your pantry, don't miss these weight loss ingredients to always have on hand.
One of the simplest ways to cut calories is to limit products that have added sugar. These simple carbs are essentially void of nutrients and can cause you to be perpetually hungry (which means you're likely to overeat). The most effective tactic is targeting beverages: sugary coffees, iced teas and soda. These liquid calories are in a class of their own: An American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that energy obtained from drinking fluids has been shown to be less satisfying than calories from solid foods, which causes us to drink more (and a greater number of calories) before we feel satisfied. Just to see how poorly your favorite stacks up among the pack, check out our exclusive report: popular sodas ranked by nutrition.
Preparing your own lunch means you put the calorie-cutting power in your own hands—not in the hands of the restaurateurs who have no stake in your weight-loss journey. Prepare any of these healthy lunches under 400 calories, and you'll save 600 calories a meal compared to if you ate at a standard sit-down restaurant, whose midday meal can average more than 1,100 calories.
A lunch break should be just that—a break! Research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that children who eat while distracted (like while watching T.V.) can consume 218 calories more in one sitting than they would otherwise. Experts explain that keeping your mind busy while eating can prevent certain satiety cues from instructing your brain that you've had your fill.You won't just get more likes on your Instagram photo. Making your food look picture-perfect can encourage you to load your plate up with more colorful, fresh veggies. What's more, it may even make your food taste better! A study published in the journal Health Psychology found that when participants spent time preparing the food they make, they found it to be significantly more satisfying than those who had the food prepared for them, even if the food was considered ""healthy.""
Eating well is essential to weight loss, but a good diet alone may not be enough to counteract all the harmful effects stress has on our bodies. A new study published in Molecular Psychiatry suggested that being stressed could even override the benefits of making better food choices! When you're constantly pulling your hair out, the stress hormone cortisol builds up in your body. And that's bad news for your belly. Cortisol forces your body to store fat and revs your hunger for high-calorie foods, meaning that you may start craving a donut even if your stomach is actually full. While improving your diet is important, you'll be more successful if you take a second to relax (and yes, taking a bubble bath counts!).
Ever heard of the seafood diet? You see food and immediately eat it! To curb your junk food consumption, start by ridding your workspace and kitchen counters of your dietary kryptonite. Keeping these vices visible will set yourself up for failure by triggering a trait dubbed by Oxford researchers as ""visual hunger:"" an evolutionary trait that increases levels of hunger hormones when we see food. Instead, hide your stash in opaque containers or in the back of your cabinet.
Look, we'll be the first to tell you we love wine—especially red wine, which actually offers antioxidants and is considered relatively healthy when consumed in moderation (no more than two glasses a day). But if you're looking to lose weight, one of our best tips is to put down the glass. Because alcohol is fairly caloric and provides relatively few nutritional benefits, drinking shouldn't be an everyday event. For example, two pints of beer a day can add nearly 2,000 calories to your weekly intake—so cutting it out can help you lose over two pounds a month. For those few times that you do choose to indulge, though, do so wisely with the help of these tips for choosing healthy alcoholic drinks.We have no issue with eating out once in awhile, but heed this advice: ask your waiter to box up half the meal before it reaches the table. A Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study discovered that the average meal at your local American, Chinese, or Italian restaurant contains a whopping 1,500 calories, so following this tip can save you a cool 750 calories. Plus, you'll get a free lunch for tomorrow!
We're singing, ""bye, bye, miss American fries!"" You can even stick with your weekly burger order from your favorite pub, just sub out the spuds for a salad. Doing so can save over 150 calories while filling you up with fiber-rich veggies that are great for improving digestive health.Here's a simple tip to avoid eating unhealthy foods: serve yourself. According to USC researchers, the simple act of having to plate your own grub, instead of having a server or friend dish out a helping for you, can curb an unhealthy indulgence. So next time you're celebrating a coworker's birthday, serve (and cut!) your own slice of cake.Here's a great excuse for date night!: A new Cornell study found that men are at unique risk of overeating in social situations—even if there isn't an incentive to do so. ""Even if men aren't thinking about it, eating more than a friend tends to be understood as a demonstration of virility and strength,"" explained co-author of the study, Kevin Kniffin, PhD. So instead of meeting up with a whole crew for a night out, opt for a romantic dinner for two or see your guy friends one at a time to keep yourself from overdoing it.
Comfort foods earn a spot in our hearts because they taste good and evoke strong, pleasant memories of growing up. Although it's OK to indulge in one of these classics once in awhile, you may want to cut down on the number of mom's recipes in your weekly roundup. According to an analysis of 30 years of data by the London School of Economics, the traditional meals your parents and grandparents used to make are simply too caloric for our less-active generation. Instead, don't be afraid to venture out of your comfort zone and check out healthier recipes: start with these 20 Healthy Sandwich Recipes!
It can seem like a simple fix when you're going on a diet, but don't fall prey to these marketing ploys. ""Diet"" foods are usually loaded with artificial sugars like sucralose and aspartame. Although artificially sweetened beverages contain fewer calories than sugary versions, a review of more than 30 years of studies found there to be no solid evidence that sugar-free alternatives prevent weight gain. Although artificially sweetened beverages contain fewer calories than sugary versions, researchers say they still trigger sweet receptors in the brain, which may make people crave food. Coupled with the fact that most people view diet drinks as healthier, it could lead to over-consumption, the researchers argue.You already know that restaurant dishes are high in calories, but we're not just talking about takeout. A study published in the journal BMJ Open found that most food Americans eat is ""ultra-processed,"" which means a product is made of several processed ingredients like flavors, colors, sweeteners, emulsifiers and other additives to disguise its undesirable qualities. Examples include store-bought items like bread, frozen meals, soda, pizza, and breakfast cereals. Not only do ultra-processed foods lack nutrients that protect against health issues, they make up 90 percent of our added-sugar intake, which causes a range of health issues from obesity to type II diabetes. Sub out a Lean Cuisine for a home-cooked dinner, a bowl of cereal or a couple of eggs overeasy to spare your tummy the trouble.How many times have you battled through a cup of ice cream while praying your stomach doesn't start acting up? Although you might feel like it's not a big deal to push your body to its limit, you might be missing the root of the issue: you could be suffering from a food intolerance or allergy. So, each time you eat dairy, gluten or refined grains, it can contribute to extra inflammation, a weakened immune system, and weight gain. Learn to listen to what your body tells you by keeping note of any discomfort in a food journal. Or try an elimination diet—call in the pros for help if you're experiencing one of these signs you should see a nutritionist.You don't have to keep up with the latest food trends and cook your way through every foodie magazine on the shelves to get lean. In fact, trying to switch up your routine too often can feel tedious and time-consuming, which may cause you to abandon your dinner plans and just order high-calorie takeout. Instead, make eating choices easy by finding a few favorite healthy, go-to recipes and stick to them so you can lose weight without exercise.
Fast food isn't just bad for you because it's full of gross additives and chemicals; it's also because it's precisely engineered to be eaten as quickly as possible. And that's bad news because you can end up eating more than your body needs to feel full. It takes roughly 20 minutes for your stomach to signal to your brain that you've eaten your fill. Eat your meal at superspeed, and you're more likely to overeat. Our suggestion? Take time to chat with your friends and family while you eat. Put your fork down. Chew slowly. Anything that will extend your meal until the 20-minute mark.
It may not be groundbreaking advice, but it's tried and true: portion control saves you hundreds of calories in the long run. Ordering your favorite latte in a tall size instead of a venti can save you at least 150 calories per Starbucks run. Want more simple ways to stick to serving sizes? Check out these easy ways to control portion sizes.Here's another reason to skip the gym: not only do studies show your body burns more calories when you exercise outdoors compared to indoors, but an Environmental Science & Technology study recently found that you're also more likely to report a greater sense of pleasure, enthusiasm, and self-esteem and lower sense of depression, tension, and fatigue simply by walking in nature compared to on a dreary treadmill. Of course, it's a bonus that you're burning more calories, but Cornell researchers have also found that improving your mental health and mood can lead to healthier food choices.
We're huge proponents of family dinners, but make sure to plate your home-cooked meals before sitting at the table. When you dine buffet-style from the counter rather than laying out each dish on the dining room table, it causes people to think twice about whether they really need another helping before getting up to serve themselves again. When the food is right in front of their plate and within reach, it's much harder to turn it away, and family dinners could turn into one of the 50 Little Things Making You Fatter and Fatter.
Research has shown eating eggs for breakfast can make you feel more full and help you eat fewer calories throughout the day, meaning they're quite the secret weapon for weight loss. Nutritionally speaking, one large hard-boiled egg (about 50 grams) contains less than one gram of carbs and remains an excellent source of protein. Eggs are also loaded with amino acids, antioxidants, and healthy fats.
There's no denying dinner rolls are delicious, but when dining out, instead of carb-loading so early on in the meal, steer clear of the bread basket and order a leafy green salad instead. If the bread basket is still too tempting to avoid, try munching on a high-fiber snack before leaving the house, such as a handful of nuts. The fiber found in nuts will keep you satiated, meaning you won't be as easily induced to reach for the bread and butter, and you'll be swapping out unhealthy fats for healthy ones. It's a win-win!
Much like drinking your coffee black, it's important to keep your drink orders as simple as possible. A 2012 CDC study found that the average adult consumes about 100 calories worth of alcohol daily, but favoring a glass of wine instead of beer or sugary cocktails can drastically reduce that figure and make your waistline slimmer. In addition to having fewer calories than most alcoholic beverages, red wine, in particular, contains resveratrol, an antioxidant that is believed to have heart health benefits because it helps prevent blood vessel damage and reduces your 'bad cholesterol.' Just remember to imbibe in moderation.
Research first linked TV watching to obesity more than 25 years ago, and since then additional research has been done to indicate how screen time in general (time spent in front of computers, iPads, etc.) can contribute to weight gain. Since watching TV or surfing the Internet during a meal can be distracting, a Harvard study found it tends to lead people to eat more and thus consume more calories. Instead, experts advise unplugging during mealtime so you can focus on what you are eating, that way you won't overeat and you'll know when you're full.
If your dress code allows, wear jeans to work. A study by the American Council on Exercise found that casual clothing, as opposed to traditional business attire, can increase physical activity levels in one's daily routine. Participants in the study took an additional 491 steps and burned 25 more calories, on days they wore denim than when wearing traditional work attire. In fact, even just donning denim on Casual Friday can make an impact. Researchers say keeping it casual just once a week could slash 6,250 calories over the course of the year—enough to offset the average annual weight gain (0.4 to 1.8 pounds) experienced by most Americans.
Speaking of work, it's no secret that being chained to a desk all day is bad for your overall health. However, simply standing at a desk as opposed to sitting has been shown to contribute to weight loss. Researchers found standing burns about 54 calories over a six-hour day, and although that might not sound like much, those calories accumulate quickly. At that rate, you can burn over 1,000 calories a month just by staying on your feet.
Believe it or not, a myriad of studies have shown that simply turning down the thermostat by a few degrees can help you lose weight because cooler temperatures force the body to work harder to stay warm. For a 2013 Japanese study, participants were exposed to 63 degrees two hours a day for six weeks. At the study's end, their average body fat mass decreased by about five percent.
Even if you don't have time to hit the gym, getting your heart pumping each day can contribute to weight loss. Whether it's taking the dog for a morning walk or using the stairs instead of the elevator, increasing your heart rate even briefly each day will keep your body healthy and in shape, thus reducing unwanted weight gain.
Though it may sound silly, the color of your dishware and the color of your food can determine whether you eat more or less. Per a recent study from Cornell University, diners actually serve themselves more food if the color of their food matches the color of their plate. In other words, if you're eating from a white plate, you're more likely to help yourself to more rice or pasta. Conversely, if your goal is to eat less, select plates that have high contrast with what you plan to serve for dinner.
Speaking of dishes, purchasing smaller ones can also help you lose weight without exercise because smaller dishes mean smaller portion size. By filling up a smaller plate, you can actually trick your brain into thinking it's consuming more calories than it would if the same amount of food was placed on a larger dish.
Common sense states if you want to lose weight you shouldn't have a large meal not long before going to bed, and now we have additional research to back up that hypothesis. A study published in The Obesity Society followed two groups of overweight women with metabolic syndrome on identical 1,400-calorie weight loss diets for 12 weeks. While both groups consumed 500 calories at lunch, one group consumed 700 calories for breakfast and a 200-calorie dinner (the ""big breakfast"" group), while the other group ate 200 calories at breakfast and 700 calories at dinner (the ""big dinner"" group). Even though the nutrient content of the meals was exactly the same for both groups, after three months the big breakfast group lost about two and a half times more weight than big dinner group.
Though you may think skipping a meal such as breakfast will help you lose weight because you would be consuming fewer calories, numerous studies have actually shown that bailing on breakfast is bad for your waistline. ""Why,"" you ask? It turns out that skipping breakfast not only means you'll likely consume more calories later in the day, but eating more calories in the later part of the day is a nightmare for metabolic circadian rhythms, which help keep your weight in check.
If you feel yourself getting those midday hunger pangs, put down the soda and candy bar and opt for some nuts instead. Walnuts, almonds, cashews, and Brazil nuts are all low in carbs while also being excellent sources of good fats and fiber, meaning they keep you fuller longer. According to a study in The Journal of Nutrition, eating almonds with main meals reduces some markers of oxidative damage, which improves your overall health.Although white potatoes offer some potassium and fiber, sweet potatoes reign supreme in the nutrition department, so always reach for sweet potatoes instead of their white counterparts. A large sweet potato contains around 4 grams of satiety-boosting protein, 25 percent of the day's belly-filling fiber, and 11 times the recommended daily intake of vitamin A. What's more? It's less than 200 calories. By contrast, a white potato has upwards of 250 calories.
It should come as no surprise that what you put on your plate matters, especially if you're trying to shed some pounds. For a balanced and healthy diet, two-thirds of your dinner plate, for example, should consist of lean meats and vegetables—think salmon and broccoli or turkey and spinach. The remaining third can consist of starch, but even then aim for healthier choices such as whole grains, lentils, or sweet potatoes.
It's not just important to snack healthily throughout the day, but it's also crucial to know when you should snack. A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found mid-morning snackers typically eat more over the course of a day than afternoon snackers. Furthermore, researchers found that dieters with the mid-morning munchies lost an average of 7 percent of their total body weight while those who did not snack before lunch lost more than 11 percent of their body weight. That's a difference of nearly 6.5 pounds for a 160-pound woman with a weight-loss goal.
Not only is drinking lemon water a healthy, low-calorie alternative to soda or juice, but lemons themselves have also been shown to contribute to weight loss. Just one lemon contains an entire day's worth of vitamin C, a nutrient that has the power to reduce levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that triggers hunger and fat storage. Additionally, lemons also contain polyphenols, which researchers say may ward off fat accumulation and weight gain. Believe it or not, even the peel is beneficial because it is a potent source of pectin—a soluble fiber that's been proven to help people feel fuller, longer. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, participants who ate just 5 grams of pectin experienced more satiety.
Beans can help boost feelings of fullness and manage blood sugar levels, making them an excellent ally in your weight loss battle. In fact, a recent study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating one serving a day of beans, peas, chickpeas or lentils could contribute to modest weight loss. Kidney beans, in particular, are an excellent source of fiber while also being low in carbs, making them an ideal pantry staple for those looking to shed a few pounds.
Not only is tea a low-calorie alternative to coffee-based drinks that tend to be packed with milk and sugar, but certain varieties of the soothing beverage can actually help contribute to weight loss. For example, Nicole Anziani, MS, RD, CDE, suggests drinking cinnamon tea because the cozy beverage may even help decrease blood sugar due to cinnamon's effect on blood glucose. Similarly, mint tea can help with weight loss because mint is an appetite suppressant. An animal study published in the Journal of Digestive Diseases found that peppermint oil can relax stomach muscles, which can increase bile flow and improving the digestion of fats.RELATED: What Happens to Your Body If You Drink Tea Every Day
Zucchini noodles look like spaghetti, but the similarities pretty much end there. Eating zoodles over pasta cuts out empty carbs to help you lose weight without exercise, but it also adds ever-important vitamins and fiber. Whilee two cups of pasta contain 480 calories, 90 grams of carbs, and 2 grams of fiber, two cups of zucchini zoodles boast 66 calories, 12 grams of carbs, and 4 grams of fiber. If prepared well, zoodles can be just as flavorful as a bowl of spaghetti, and they can easily help you achieve your weight loss goals.

Any individual with a higher BMI is known to have an increased risk of several disorders such as diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. However, immediate weight loss may not be healthy. Trying to lose weight in 7 days can do more harm than good.While weight loss can be a challenge for any individual, the popularity of weight loss programmes have been through the roof. Unfortunately, many people seem to aim to lose a lot of weight in shorter periods of time. As satisfying as it may seem to lose 10 kg in a week, the practice is not recommended by nutritionists. Fads that help achieve such goals should be avoided since they do have harmful side effects.Ideally, one’s weight loss journey must be planned according to their needs, body type, and preferences. It is essential to design these programmes in a sustainable manner in order to ensure that one is not adversely affected in the long-term.While losing a significant amount of weight in a week is not practical, we have a few tips to help you get started on your weight loss journey. Simply remember to maintain a healthy, balanced diet, and not any fad diet that you may find.Consider what you can add to your regular diet rather than what you must not consume when you wish to lose weight. Ideally, consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and pulses.Most dietitians recommend that you do not skip any meals. Ensure that you control your meal portions and that you receive all the nutrients you need from the food you eat. If you wish to lose weight in a goal-oriented manner, make sure to cut back on carbohydrates, salt, butter, sugar, and fried foods.The easiest way to adopt these changes is to prepare your food yourself, and staying mindful of what exactly you are eating.An important component of any weight loss diet is protein. Adding the nutrient to your meals will help you remain full for long after you have consumed them. A high-protein and moderate carbohydrate diet helps preserve muscle mass and encourage the fat burning process.It was found by a recent study that an increase of one’s protein intake by 25% helped reduce their midnight cravings by 60%. Consume high protein sources like lean meat, nuts, dairy, and even dairy products like milk, yogurt and cheese, and keep your weight loss journey going.One of the most important tasks in your weight loss journey is to track your calories. In order to lose weight, one must burn more calories than they consume. Keeping tabs on your calories helps you keep understand where you stand in your fitness journey.While most people do keep track of their calorie intake, it is just as necessary to know how many calories one is burning at the same time. In addition to helping you understand how you are doing, tracking your calories can also help you remain motivated.Cutting down on junk food may not be easy for any individual. While it may be challenging to give up on one’s fries and chips, it is possible to replace them with healthier snacking options.For example, you can replace your cookies and pastries with a box of mixed nuts. While these nuts may be high in fat, they prove effective against heart diseases, and certain cancers. You can also opt to munch on some apple slices with peanut butter.If you have a sweet tooth, you need not refuse to satisfy your cravings entirely. Substitute the usual high-calorie options with chewing gum, which will satisfy your cravings.You could also replace the calorie-rich foods you crave for with fruits or berries. Rich in antioxidants, they also help in reducing the risk of heart diseases. Another healthy fix for these temptations would be to eat dark chocolate, as it contributes to good heart health too.Lastly, it is extremely important to make the switch from sodas and fizzy drinks to fruit juices and water.More often than not, people tend to mistake their thirst for hunger. If you think you are feeling hungry, drink a glass of water first. Water contains no calories or sodium, aiding in one’s weight loss attempts.Drinking water can also help flush out impurities from the body, and improve one’s metabolism rate. You can also add a hint of lemon or a few mint leaves to add flavour to you water. You could begin your day with a glass of water that contains a pinch of lemon juice to get it off to a healthy start.Set reminders for yourself to keep drinking water in order to ensure that you stay hydrated at all times.While achieving goals immediately may seem more satisfying, this may not be sustainable. It is best to focus on realistic goals that one can achieve, rather than going after something that would be difficult to do. Ideally, you must modify your lifestyle in order to stay healthy in the long run rather than just looking to achieve your goals right away.A good amount of sleep is key to one’s weight loss journey. You can add 30 minutes to your daily sleep cycle to make sure that you are better rested. This helps you stay fresh and not skip exercises.In addition to that, seven to eight hours of sleep on a daily basis can help you improve your metabolism. You can take a short nap during the day to keep energetic and fresh for the rest of it.Motivation is key to keeping any fitness journey going. While most people start off with a lot of enthusiasm, it becomes difficult to stay motivated. One way to remain motivated would be to keep your goal in mind at all times.Another easy way to stay motivated is to keep track of your progress. If you see that your efforts are showing results, it will help you to stay on track. This is where calorie and goal tracking comes in. Make sure you know how you are improving, in order to make sure that you are motivated in your fitness journey.Exercise is central to any weight reduction goals. It is important to burn the calories that you consume through a well-planned exercise routine. That said, it is necessary to ensure that you do not risk injuring yourself by doing strenuous exercises that your body is not suited to.Ideally, try to do exercises that you like so that you can stick to the regimen in the long run. Look to exercise for around 45 minutes a day, for 5-6 days a week.Here are a few exercises you could do as part of your workout routine:Jogging can help burn more calories than any other exercise, and is known to be very useful when it comes to weight loss. Incorporate running or jogging along with interval training or speed work routine.Another useful exercise for weight loss is skipping. Ideally, one should jump rope for about 5 minutes and then take a break. Do about two to three sets of skipping as part of your daily workout routine.Swimming is a full-body workout that can help you burn up to 500 calories in a 45 minute session. Including swimming as part of your weight loss routine can prove to be extremely effective.Apart from improving circulation and building endurance, cardio workouts also aid weight loss. Add kettle bell cardio, swimming, hiking, and high-intensity interval training can help you burn more calories. A 10-minute cardio workout can help you burn about 200 to 300 calories while strengthening the legs, hips, core and back muscles.Body weight workouts can play an important role in your weight loss aspirations. Push-ups, pull-ups, planks, lunges, and squats are a few exercises that you can incorporate in your daily routine.Push-ups help build your upper body strength while lunges are key to strengthening your lower body parts. You can plan your workouts accordingly.Strength exercises like weight lifting helps burn fat, while also building strength. In addition to that, they also improve metabolism. Strength training can also improve one’s sleep quality and help them stay active.HIIT can help burn nearly 400 calories in 30 minutes of continuous exercise. The most comfortable HIIT exercise includes burpees, jumping jacks, raised arm exercises, squats, and high knees. Doing each of them for 20 seconds to for one circuit. Completing 5 of these circuits contributes to effective weight loss.Although 7-day weight loss plans are advised against by nutritionists around the world, there are a few diets that allow you to achieve the same. One of these is the GM Diet. Read about the GM Diet, its requirements and ill-effects here.However, it is ideal to follow a sustainable plan that will help you remain healthy in the long-term. These diets must be balanced and include all nutrients that your body needs. Find the best diet Indian diet plan for weight loss here.Most diets that promise immediate weight loss are fad diets that do more harm than good. Here are some of the side effects of these fad diets:Most of the weight you lose when you lose weight too quickly happens in the form of water. This can, in turn, lead to rapid dehydration. Your body burns calories in stages. If you force your body to lose weight too fast, it can cause serious health problems. Keep drinking water, and ensure you are hydrated at all times.Fad diets involve depriving your body of calories. These calories provide your body with the energy it needs for daily activities. Eating less than what your body requires on a daily basis can lead to you finding yourself tiring out too soon. Eating smaller meals throughout the day will help you speed up your metabolism while providing your body with the energy it requires.Losing weight too soon can lead to digestive problems like severe diarrhea followed by constipation. Just like losing water weight, having diarrhea for an extended period can lead to dehydration, which, over a longer period, can be life-threatening. It is recommended that your diet has good amounts of fiber in it, to avoid digestive trouble.Crash diets can be dangerous since they restrict your body from consuming fats and carbs. They also prevent the body from consuming the vitamins and minerals that it requires. If your body is not allowed its normal caloric intake over a long period of time, it will be deprived several essential nutrients and you’ll be severely malnourished.When you’re on a fad diet, you tend to lose muscle mass since your nutrient balance is not maintained. Therefore, your body tries to compensate for this by depositing more fat, even if you deviate a little from your diet. This leads to frequent weight fluctuations or yo-yo weight changes, which can be harmful to your body in many ways.You may not see results in your fitness journey as easily as you wish. It is important to remain patient, and follow a sustainable plan in order to achieve your goals. The idea is to remain healthy in the long-term by following a diet that is balanced and contains all the nutrients your body needs.It is also necessary to maintain a workout routine that is not too strenuous and can do more harm than good. Aim to do enough to burn more calories than you consume without injuring yourself. Understanding your body’s limitations and requirements is key to following the right workout routine.A: It is not recommended for one to lose as much as 10 pounds of weight in a week. The faster you attempt to lose weight, the harder it becomes to retain muscle mass.A: There are a few things that you can do to begin your weight loss journey. Some of these things are:1.

I started consuming the tablets along with the diet they shared. I lost almost 6 kg Within the first month and 5 kg in the next. Keto.to has worked very well for me.
 When I was overweight, I did not like to look into the mirror. I was so insecure with my appearance, that it was always a hassle purchasing  clothes that make me look leaner. After trying out Keto.to, I started loosing weight fast! Now I am happy to be in front of the mirror again and looking forward for an even better me in coming future. Thank you Keto.to!
This is not the first keto product I have tried but yes this is the first product that worked for me. And I no longer feel drained by the end of the day. After trying out Keto.to I started shreading weight fast! I did not realize (my wife told me) but my physical activies increased as I was filled with energy. Now everyday, I feel fitter than before. It's a great feeling!
 Trust me I tried many things to loose weight. They worked to
                                            some extent but then I gained weight again. I lost all hopes of losing
                                            weight until my friend in New York told me about benefits of keto diet. I
                                            found Keto.to online and thought of giving it a try. Their supplements along
                                            with the diet plan they made for me helped me reduce weight, without any
                                            side effects. And its been 8 months now and I have not gained weight again.
                                            Never thought that a diet food can also be delicious.

                                When ketones are present in the body, this is known as Ketosis. Ketones are produced

                                When our body fuels on carbohydrates, it is converted into glucose in the blood,
                                fueling our brain with glucose. When we restrict carbs the brain requires an
                                alternate fuel source.

That’s a reasonable thing to believe if you constantly have your Indian food in Indian Restaurants, take-aways etc. This is due to the fact that lots of conventional Indian dishes include either frying or using ghee (clarified butter). Nevertheless, if you prepare Indian food in your home, it can quickly form part of a weight-loss program, simply the exact same as other food. You simply have to follow a couple of basic guidelines.Tandoori dishes are excellent as part of a low-calorie or low-carb diet plan. Simply marinate some fish (cubed or entire), chicken (cubed or in pieces) or prawns (shrimp) in a mix of low fat plain yogurt, ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, crushed garlic, grated root ginger and a little chilli powder (or to taste) for a minimum of an hour. Thread onto skewers if you’re utilizing cubed meat. Grill or bbq with a medium heat up until done. Serve with combined salad and wedges of lemon to squeeze over. If your diet plan isn’t really too extreme, you can likewise have a pitta bread, a baked potato or some boiled rice with this.Curry meals are great too (ideally fish or chicken). If you utilize a dish that has simply a spice and water base or a tomato base, it definitely will not do your calorie consumption any damage however make certain to keep the oil you utilize for frying onions, spices, or whatever, to an outright minimum.For vegetarians or those attempting to reduce meat since of its fairly high-calorie material, Indian cooking is perfect. There are many dishes for veggies and pulses which are actually yummy that you will not even understand you’re on a diet plan!Do not forget paneer (Indian home cheese), which can be prepared based on the tandoori concept above, or in a spicy sauce. Have a go at replacing with tofu if you cannot get paneer.I’m sharing a full-day meal plan that will help you to lose 10 kilos in 10 days. This meal plan is unique as it is oil and sugar free as I have customized the diet plan with an Indian food recipe.We’ll be giving both breakfast and dinner options. This meal plan is easy to follow and is made with easily available and inexpensive ingredients. This diet will give you good results provided you don’t cheat for 10 days. I also recommend light to moderate exercise like walking.Tumeric is a natural detoxifier. The active ingredient in turmeric known as Kocaman increases thermogenesis which leads to fat burning and helps with weight loss. Although lemons taste acidic they are actually alkalizing within the body, balancing the body’s pH can help lower inflammation. Chia seeds are an ancient superfood and thought to have been a staple of Mayan and Aztec diets. the fiber in them helps you to feel full for a longer time and so it prevents the urge to have unhealthy snacks.For breakfast and Have smoothies. The first one is an apple banana smoothie. The second smoothie you can make in seconds. Just Add one roughly chopped apple one medium carrot roughly chopped, half a cup of water. I like my smoothie is likely on the thicker side, if you prefer it less thick add 1 cup water. Instead of water you can also use coconut water or any fruit juice now squeeze in one lemon, you can also use orange juice instead.Add in three dates one tablespoon of flax seeds one-quarter teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon powder or you can use a small piece of cinnamon stick and now Blend everything together until everything is nicely mixed. The apples contain compounds that promote the growth of good bacteria in your stomach the high water content and amazing amount of fiber will keep you full until your your next meal. Carrots are low in calories and full of nutrients and it will provide you with vitamin A needed for the day. Did you know that vitamin A plays a role in reducing abdominal fat. Even though dates are high in sugar they contain many different minerals these minerals can help in lowering blood pressure and regulate fluid balance in the body. Cinnamon is another miracle spice that helps in weight loss it charges belly fat suppresses your appetite and keeps you feeling fuller.Lightly toast one brown bread and topped it with one slice of boiled egg sprinkle with salt and pepper. Along with it have one sliced Apple sprinkle with freshly ground cinnamon after half an hour have one cup of green tea.   Eggs are among the healthiest food eggs are incredibly nutrient-dense and help you feel full mainly because of the high protein content high-protein foods reduce appetite and increase the feeling of fullness. In the evening have a cup of green tea. If you feel hungry you can snack on carrots cucumbers celery sticks or be two slices remember this is an oil and sugar-free diet if you crave sugary snacks you can have up to three dates.For dinner have a ball of masala oats. This lightly spiced also will make you feel fuller along with the vegetables For those who don’t like masala or you can have a simple oatmeal with Chia and Coconut.Make sure you have your dinner by at least seven-thirty p.m. and at that time have a glass of warm lemon water. Lemon is not only rich in vitamin C but it is also an immune system booster it also acts a blood purifier and improves the body’s ability to get rid of toxins lemon is also a superior body alkalizer. It helps to maintain the pH levels in the body it prevents acne and bring those and gives you glowing and clear skin.

11,https://www.kent.co.in/blog/how-drinking-water-can-help-you-lose-weight/,"Have you hit a plateau in your weight loss program, and no amount of diet and exercise helps you break it? The problem might be with water.Weight loss, as you have been often told, is essentially an outcome of how much calories you burn, against how much you consume. This means that if you have consumed 2000 calories today, but have burned off 2200, you must be on your way to weight loss, right? If only it were that simple.Weight management is actually a very complex bodily activity with several genetic, age-related and hormonal factors holding a stake. What you consume definitely has an impact on your weight, but not everyone reacts similarly to the same foods. This is basically because of BMR, or basal metabolic rate.Your BMR is unique to you, and it determines how much calories you will require for each task. Those with high BMR burn off more calories for the same tasks than those with low BMR. You can get a rough estimate of your BMR through several online calculators. Refer this one for example Body BuildingDid you know that no matter how much you exercise, your normal bodily functioning still beats your exercise routines hands down in calories consumption? This means that most of the calories you burn in a day are spent for the body to stay alive, for the heart to beat and the brain to think, for digestive process to function. Only a smaller part of the burning happens through exercise.If this is true, then why don’t some people lose weight?Your genes, or some underlying hormonal issue, could be causing you to have a low BMR. This means that you consume lesser energy than some others for your tasks, which means that every extra bite is going to pack on the pounds! Here is where water can really help you get back towards meaningful results.To begin with, our bodies are made of almost 65% water. Water is in every cell and fibre of our being, and the brain is almost 75% water! Therefore, proper regulation of water levels in the body can go a long way in weight management. (Source: Wiki How)Drink adequate water, and drink often! Drinking water during the day can help keep you feeling full without consuming high-calorie beverages such as milk, tea with milk, juice, and snacks.Drink a glass of water before every meal. The feeling of fullness will help you eat less, thus consuming fewer calories for improved weight loss resultsReplace sweetened drinks with water. Instead of drinking soda, alcoholic beverages, smoothies, or other high-calorie drinks, grab a glass or bottle of water. Swapping in a zero-calorie beverage for high-calorie alternatives can spare you hundreds of calories per dayMatch any alcohol consumption with equal amounts of water. This matched fluid intake should not count toward your daily water intake.Drink a warm glass of water at bedtime, and a couple more after waking up, to eliminate constipation and keep your bowels regular. Constipation could be a reason for bloated guts and a feeling of heavinessConsume warm water in the form of green tea at least twice a day, because warm water quickly preps up digestion, and green tea helps detox the bodyWater is one of the most critical factors in fat metabolism. No matter how much you exercise, to metabolise fat and eliminate the ensuing toxins, the body needs an ample and constant supply of water. When you exercise a lot but don’t consume enough water, you are preventing fat from being effectively metabolised, and the resultant dehydration might leave you feeling tired and cramped.Therefore, add a few litres of purified water through the day, and see the fat melt right off!Your email address will not be published.

12,https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/9688163/weight-loss-fast-easy-body-type/,"SUMMER is just packed full of events - from holidays to BBQs and weddings.

And with most of us are leading busier lives than ever before, finding the time to lose weight can be difficultBut what if there was a simple way to get rid of your belly fat in just 10 days.

One personal trainer says it is entirely possible - and it doesn't involve doing a million sit-ups. Hooray!

Rachael Attard, a personal trainer based in Sydney, Australia, says on her blog there are four steps to follow to banish your muffin top.

And it starts with understanding your body type...

1. Work out your body type
You've seen yourself a million times, so you probably know what you look like, right?

Well, even if you've really stared at yourself have you ever figured out your exact body type?

Rachael explains that some body types tend to lose fat faster than others, so it really is worth knowing what category you come under.

This way you can optimise your diet and workout efforts instead of wasting time.

Generally speaking, there are three different body types:

Endomorph

People with endomorph body type tend to naturally have higher percentages of body fat.

Think Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Kate Winslet.

""They store fat more easily, typically around the belly, thighs, and butt,"" says Rachael. ""And getting rid of fat is often harder for them.""

Endomorphs typically benefit from following a low carb diet and doing more cardio than the other two  body types.

Ectomorph

Ectomorphs tend to be naturally lean, though they can still have the ""skinny fat look"" with stubborn belly fat, Rachael says.

She says that people with this body type tend to struggle to put on muscle and can find it tough to stay toned.

""Unlike endomorphs, ectomorphs do best on a high carb diet and they don’t need to focus on cardio a lot, unless they have extra body fat they want to lose,"" she added.

Celebrities including Keira Knightly and Karlie Kloss are considered ectomorphs.

Mesomporph

The best of both worlds, mesomorphs are somewhere in the middle of the other two body types.

Rachael says: ""They can store body fat more easily than ectomorphs, but it’s easier for them to lose it than it is for endomorphs.

""They do best following a balanced diet and with doing moderate amounts of cardio for fat loss.""

Famous mesomorphs include Gigi Hadid, Jennifer Lawrence and Irina Shayk.

2. Focus on nutrition
After you've identified your body type, you can start eating accordingly to lose belly fat quicker.

Rachael says that nutrition is the key to shifting the pounds in less than two weeks.

She says: ""If your diet is not on point, you won’t get any results, especially not in just 10 days!

""Cut out all junk food, processed food, bad carbs, sugar, and alcohol for the full 10 days. No cheating.

""And you need to eat the right amount of food for your body type.

""If you have no idea about the calories and macros in your food, try counting it for a few days.""

She recommends trying a calorie counter, like the free app MyFitnessPal, to get an idea of how much food you should be eating.

Rachael added: ""This will give you a good idea on how much you’re actually eating, and you’ll know if you need to eat more or less.

""And if you need to eat more carbs, less carbs, more protein, etc.""

3. Reduce stress
None of us want to lead stressful lives, so this one is probably easier said than done.

But Rachael says limiting the amount of stress you experience plays a big part in shifting the fat.

""When you are stressed, your body releases the stress hormone called cortisol. Constantly high levels of cortisol will result in your body storing fat, especially around the stomach.

""So if you put too much pressure on yourself about fat loss and exercise too hard or become extremely strict with your diet, it might actually backfire.""

Instead, she says to avoid things that could be putting you under stress - that means if you're putting pressure on yourself to exercise constantly then don't, it's detrimental.

Aim for eight hours sleep and ditch that bad relationship too, she adds.

4. Exercise correctly
While diet is the crucial component to losing weight fast, it's important to do some exercise too.

""You don’t need to do tons of workouts. You need to do the right type of workouts.

""Incorporate high intensity workouts to lose belly fat quickly - running and HIIT work best.""

HIIT – AKA high-intensity interval training – mixes bursts of hard, fast moves that aim to take your heart rate up to 90% of its maximum, with short recovery periods in which you rest.

For example, you can sprint for 30 seconds and then rest for 30-60 seconds to give your heart rate a chance to calm down",6.915,9.06,6.3,9.28,3.02,778

14,https://www.hairguard.com/hyaluronic-acid-hair-growth/,"When you suffer from chronic hair loss, it can seem as if your body is constantly working against you. You may be surprised to learn, then, that the body actually has many naturally-occurring molecules that work to promote hair growth.One such molecule that supports a healthy hair growth cycle is hyaluronic acid.Hyaluronic acid has been used in the cosmetics industry for decades. The molecule has gained mainstream popularity more recently, though.So what is hyaluronic acid, and how might it help to promote hair growth? This article will answer those questions and more.Hyaluronic Acid (HA), also known as hyaluronan, is a naturally-occurring molecule within the body. It’s a glycosaminoglycan, which simply means it’s a long chain of carbohydrate molecules bound together. Another glycosaminoglycan that you may have heard of is keratin.The main role of hyaluronic acid in the body is as a humectant. The molecule attracts water to the skin where it then binds to collagen. This makes the skin appear plumper and more youthful as collagen forms the structure of the skin.There are various names for hyaluronic acid as it’s used in cosmetics. The most common include hyaluronan, sodium hyaluronate, hyaluran, and hylan.You may be wondering why hyaluronic acid has gained such popularity in the cosmetic industries in the past few years. Here’s a quick look at a few of the molecule’s skin and hair benefits which explains much of its popularity.Hyaluronic acid’s main claim to fame is its ability to hydrate the skin.It works by first binding to collagen molecules within the skin. It then draws water to itself, which “bulks up” the collagen molecule. This ends up trapping the collagen molecule within the skin so it appears fuller, firmer, and more dewy-looking.That’s not all, though.As a humectant, it’s in hyaluronic acid’s very nature to draw water to the skin. There are many factors, both external and internal, that can cause the skin to lose its water content quickly, though. These include skin conditions, harsh weather, and even certain cosmetic products.The great thing about hyaluronic acid is that it’s also a moisturizer. This means it not only draws water to the skin but it also locks it in.Whether you’re looking to soothe an irritated scalp or treat an underlying condition, hyaluronic acid has also been shown to promote healing.When the scalp is injured or otherwise irritated (such as from DHT sensitivity at the follicles), the body’s natural healing process will begin. There are four steps in this healing process:In the event of a wound, hemostasis is the first step. This involves constriction of the surrounding blood vessels as well as blood clotting.Next is inflammation. While chronic inflammation is damaging, temporary inflammation as part of the healing process can be beneficial. This is what signals to the body that a traumatic event has taken place. This is when white blood cells (lymphocytes) and anti-inflammatories (cytokines) rush to the area.Then there is proliferation. This is the phase when the skin begins to visibly heal over as new skin cells are produced. There is also the formation of new blood vessels, and the synthesis of collagen (one of the skin’s most important protein complexes) begins.And finally is remodeling. Now that collagen has been synthesized, it can model itself naturally. This is when the new blood vessels have also established themselves, and the final stages of repair to the skin and surrounding tissues are complete.So, where does hyaluronic acid fit in?Hyaluronic acid plays a role in at least two of the four healing stages.For one, hyaluronic acid helps to regulate inflammation levels. It does so by flooding into the area during the second stage of the healing process (inflammation) both as a pro-inflammatory agent (low molecular weight HA) and as an anti-inflammatory (high molecular weight HA).Its second role in healing is in angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels. It has been found that HA is useful in both initiating and regulating angiogenesis “under physiologic and pathologic scenarios.”What does this mean exactly?It seems that the main role of hyaluronic acid is to maintain tissue homeostasis. Using both structural and cell-signaling cues, this polysaccharide chain helps to maintain the delicate balance that is required for healthy tissues.Now, how does this relate to hair growth?In the event of a chronic condition (such as androgenetic alopecia) that triggers inflammation, hyaluronic acid can both combat inflammation and help to create new blood vessels to the area. This means that hyaluronic acid has two-fold benefits:Hyaluronic acid isn’t just for hair growth, though. It’s also likely to be beneficial for various other skin conditions that affect the quality of your scalp and hair.Oxidative stress is the process by which free radials build up within the body and cause damage to various tissues as a result. This is often implicated as the “cause” of aging, and it’s also thought to be linked to hair loss.Free radicals are molecules that are missing an electron. The loss of electrons happens naturally during cellular metabolism. The free radicals, however, still need an electron to be “complete” so they attempt to steal electrons from surrounding tissues.The loss of an electron will obviously damage the molecule and, if enough of a tissue’s molecules lose their electrons, the tissue itself will become damaged.What’s the answer to this problem? Antioxidants!Hyaluronic acid is an antioxidant which has been shown to effectively combat oxidative stress. Its role as an antioxidant is to donate its own electron to roaming free radicals so as to prevent tissue damage and breakdown.Is it likely that oxidative stress is the sole cause of your hair loss? No. However, the presence of free radicals within the body may contribute to the difficulty you face in hair regrowth. As such, the use of antioxidants like hyaluronic acid is highly recommended for anyone struggling with hair loss.To understand the potential mechanism of hyaluronic acid for hair growth, you first need to understand why hair loss occurs.Hair loss is an umbrella term that includes an array of conditions, including androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness), alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, etc.These conditions have their own underlying causes, and some of them are easier to treat than others.While there have yet to be studies done, the type of hair loss that may benefit the most from hyaluronic acid use is pattern baldness.This is because two of hyaluronic acid’s proven mechanisms – inflammation regulation and new blood vessel formation – can work to directly combat the condition’s effects.There are two main theories regarding pattern baldness: the DHT Theory and the Scalp Tension theory. While these theories suggest different initial causes, they both come down to one thing: DHT sensitivity at the hair follicle.In the DHT theory, those with pattern baldness are genetically predisposed to DHT sensitivity at the hair follicle. They also appear to have greater levels of DHT at the scalp. This is believed to trigger miniaturization of the follicle.In the Scalp Tension theory, it’s thought that chronic scalp tension is the trigger for follicular DHT sensitivity. This then lends itself to the inflammation and miniaturization seen in those with genetic hair loss.As you can see, the outcome is the same: the hair follicles become miniaturized due to inflammation. This means poor blood flow, decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery, etc.Now on to how hyaluronic acid may be able to help.As mentioned in the previous section, hyaluronic acid has been shown to regulate inflammation levels. This means it can mediate the inflammatory response to reduce inflammation at the site of injury (or miniaturization in this case).What does this mean?Hyaluronic acid may be able to reverse miniaturization and its effects (shedding, scalp calcification, etc.) by simply reducing inflammation at the follicle. What’s more, it might even be able to increase blood flow to the area to further promote healing.There are a few ways to use hyaluronic acid for the potential benefit of hair growth. Let’s take a look!If your shampoo doesn’t already include hyaluronic acid (remember, it can appear under various names listed above!), you can add it to your current shampoo.To apply hyaluronic acid to the scalp, first apply it to your fingertips or use a medicine dropper to apply directly to the hairline. You’ll want to start out with just a few drops, but you can add more if you feel you need it.Using your fingertips, gently massage the hyaluronic acid into your scalp using smooth, circular motions. You should focus on the areas with the most pronounced hair loss, but you can safely apply it all over the scalp, too.Then just wash your hands and allow the hyaluronic acid to soak into the scalp. I’d suggest you leave it in overnight for best results.Since hyaluronic acid is lightweight and watery, it won’t weigh your hair down. You can apply it right after a shower (the best time for absorption) or to a dry scalp.I spoke briefly above about the Scalp Tension theory of hair loss. You may be wondering what you can do to treat chronic scalp tension. One answer? Scalp massage.Scalp massage is a technique where you apply manual stimulation to the scalp using your hands or a specialty massage tool. The benefits of scalp massage are numerous, and when it comes to fighting hair loss they include:This may seem too good to be true, but studies on the topic are very encouraging.If you suffer from pattern baldness, scalp massage is a great technique to add to your hair care routine. And best of all, it only takes 10 to 15 minutes once per day to see results.To learn more about scalp massage techniques, go here.One other benefit to scalp massage is that you can use this technique to apply topicals to your scalp. This includes hyaluronic acid.One way to use hyaluronic acid is to apply it directly to the scalp, which I’ve mentioned above. By adding it into your scalp massage routine, though, you can further ensure its spread and absorption.The best way to reap the benefits is to add hyaluronic acid to your scalp as soon as you begin the massage. This will ensure the product is spread evenly throughout the scalp. You may also want to apply a few drops to the “problem” areas afterwards just to be sure they received their fair share.Then leave it in for at least 2 hours. You can also leave it in overnight (recommended).Do you want to increase the amount of hyaluronic acid absorbed through the skin? Apply it after a microneedling session!The skin is quite adept at absorbing whatever is applied to it. If you want to increase the absorption rate, though, you can apply hyaluronic acid to the scalp immediately after you microneedle.Microneedling is a skin procedure that uses tiny needles to wound the scalp. These wounds will go through the healing process which has been shown to promote new hair growth.To learn more about microneedling, and how you can do it at home, go here.In addition to increasing absorption rate, the hyaluronic acid may speed up the healing process. This can, in turn, lend itself to faster hair growth.There are plenty of cosmetic products, including serums and sprays, that include hyaluronic acid as a main ingredient. This may be a good option if you’re looking for a ‘boost.’As of this writing, hyaluronic acid injections are FDA-approved for use in eye surgeries and in treating eye injuries. They are not FDA-approved for use as a hair growth agent, but your dermatologist may recommend the off-label use in certain cases.The benefit of an injection over topical application is the amount of hyaluronic acid that’s actually making it to the hair follicles and cells. Absorption through the skin is quite effective, but injection ensures almost 100% delivery of the ingredient.If you have a more advanced stage of pattern baldness (Norwood scale 4+) then you might also want to consider injection. This is because the skin thickens as hair loss worsens. This is a process known as scalp calcification.When this occurs, it becomes more difficult for products to penetrate the skin. This means that anything you apply may simply sit on the surface of the skin. Injections enable you to bypass the skin entirely.If you’re interested in learning more about hyaluronic acid injections, speak with your dermatologist.As with any product that you apply to your skin, there is always a slight risk of sensitivity or allergic reactions.The signs of an allergic reaction include redness, itching, hives, swelling, and skin that’s hot to the touch. If you experience such a reaction, discontinue use of hyaluronic acid immediately.If your dermatologist recommends a hyaluronic acid injection, there are other potential side effects to consider. These include difficulty with moving, muscle pain and/or stiffness, and pain in the joints. These side effects should be short lived. If they last for longer than a few days, or if they worsen over time, contact your doctor immediately.If you have scleroderma, don’t use hyaluronic acid on your skin.As a molecule that’s found naturally in the body, hyaluronic acid is a relatively safe and scientifically-backed cosmetic ingredient. It’s been growing in popularity over the past few decades, and there’s plenty of evidence to back its benefits.As it relates to hair growth, hyaluronic acid has plenty of direct benefits. It’s thought toWhen combined, it’s thought that these benefits can promote hair growth even in spite of hair loss conditions such as androgenetic alopecia.Is hyaluronic acid the answer to your hair loss woes? While it can provide many benefits, it’s best used alongside other approved hair loss treatments.

16,https://www.hairlossdoctors.com/blog/2018/06/21/causes-of-hair-loss-in-191361,"Hair loss among teenage girls is generally rare, especially given that significant hair thinning among females usually occurs later in life. For perspective, a person normally loses about 50 to 100 hairs a day. For hair thinning to be noticeable, a person would have to consistently lose much ore hair than that over the course of many years.The hair restoration surgeons at our New York, NY practice offer plenty of options for hair loss treatment. Let’s go over the common reasons or hair thinning among teenage girls and offer a quick overview of the treatment process.Female hair thinning can begin before a female reaches adulthood. However, it would need to be significant for the hair loss to be noticeable. Unlike men, women lose hair from all over the scalp, meaning the the thinning tends to be harder to detect even if it is occurring.Tight ponytails, brains, and heavy extensions can place a great deal of stress on the scalp and your hair follicles. Additionally, bleaching, dying, straightening, and perming can all lead to scalp problems as well. Too much pulling and too much styling can make hair thinning and even bald patches more likely.A healthy diet means your body functions just the way it should. An unhealthy diet lacking in certain vitamins and nutrients, or one that’s heavy ion process foods, can result in hair loss and thinning.Somewhat related to the issue of diet, iron deficiency in young girls can also contribute to hair loss. If you suffer from anemia or it runs in the family, be sure to eat an iron-rich diet and take supplements as necessary.Being a girl today can be difficult. Combine social pressures with the realities of adolescence as well as changing hormones and you have a recipe for stress. Unfortunately, stress can contribute to hair loss and hair thinning.Medications have side effects, and some may be less desirable than others. As it turns out, many teens take prescription drugs to help treat acne, depression, and mood disorders. Sometimes these drugs can cause hair loss as a side effect.Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its own hair follicles. This leads to bald patches in portions of the scalp. It’s estimated that 1 in 50 people will experience some degree of alopecia areata at some point of their life.Trichotillomania is a psychological disorder in which a person compulsively pulls out his or her own hair. This condition affects roughly 2.5 millions people, and is most common in children between the ages of 9 and 13.There are many options for treating female hair loss, many of which involve proper diagnosis of is cause or causes. During a visit to the practice, we can discuss your situation and offer solutions that will help promote a healthy scalp and a full head of hair.For more information about treating female hair loss and improving the density of your hair, be sure to contact our team of hair restoration specialists.

20,https://hudabeauty.com/us/en_US/blog/hair-loss-causes-best-treatments-65052.html,"FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS $60+BOOK YOUR VIRTUAL BEAUTY CONSULTATIONHey my loves! I recently opened up about my struggle with endometriosis and PCOS, and I was so overwhelmed by your love and support. As a result of both of these issues, I have struggled with hair balding since my 20s. I know I’m not alone in this, so I really wanted to be open about my hair loss issues with you guys, as it’s not often spoken about.Most recently, I had a really scary incident where I discovered a bald spot at the top of my head. This was created by wearing a super tight and heavy ponytail that caused damage to the hair follicle, which meant all the hair here fell out. It’s called traction alopecia and it’s quite common when you wear very tight hairstyles or heavy extensions.But the truth is, there are so many different causes of hair loss, so I wanted to reach out to some amazing experts to help you guys understand why you may be experiencing hair loss and the different treatments and remedies you can try. Mostly, I think it’s important for us to talk about it because it’s not something we should feel ashamed of.˙In fact, Marc R Avram MD, hair loss specialist and Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical school in New York City, told us that male and female pattern hair loss is a lot more common than you might think: “About 50% of men and 30 to 50% of women will have it. We do not know the exact genes that cause it but we know it comes from both our parents.” So actually, most of us will experience hair loss, we just don’t talk about it. It also means it’s definitely worth knowing and understanding the signs so that you can treat any hair loss from the first symptoms.Shanthi Colaço, MD, FAAD, a board-certified cosmetic and general dermatologist who provides long-term hair loss treatments says “The most common type of hair loss in women is the same as it is in men: androgenetic (hereditary) alopecia, also known as female (or male) pattern hair loss (FPHL or MPHL).“Women often see diffused hair thinning and/or a widening part, whereas men see a receding hairline and/or a bald patch at the crown of the scalp. Luckily, women rarely become bald. In both sexes, hair loss from androgenetic alopecia occurs because the growing phase (anagen) of the hair cycle shortens causing the hair shaft to get thinner and thinner over time until eventually it falls out and doesn’t regrow.”Dr. Colaço also says that female pattern hair loss can start any time after the onset of puberty, “But is most commonly seen around menopause, which supports an additional hormonal cause. Women normally produce some androgen or male hormone (i.e. testosterone) as this has important functions in both sexes. But when there is excess androgen activity, hair loss can occur.”There are so many possible reasons for hair loss, which means it’s crucial to see a doctor as soon as possible. Dr. Colaço outlines some other causes:Stress: “Chronic stress and the resulting inflammation is linked to a wide variety of medical problems, including hair loss. Physical and/or emotional stress shifts hair from the growth cycle to the resting cycle, in which it is more likely to fall out,” Dr. Colaço tells us. She also mentions that for this type of hair loss there are no targeted treatments.Poor diet: Another cause for hair loss can also be related to your diet, and Dr. Colaço stresses that “A balanced diet is necessary for strong, healthy hair. When you don’t get the vitamins, minerals, protein, and other nutrients that your body needs, it can cause hair to fall out. For example, iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of hair loss in women.”Extreme weight loss: So, while diet deficiencies, including iron, can be a cause, Dr. Avram also says “If your diet or weight is not stable or if you have a chronic medical disease, that can affect the absorption of vitamins in our bowels and vitamin supplements may be needed.” However, he says this is often quite rare in comparison to the other causes of hair loss. Finally, extreme weight loss, for example, if you were to lose 15 to 20 lbs in a short amount of time, could also contribute to some hair loss.

 7 Essential Rules For Growing Your Hair Really Long!


Thyroid: “The thyroid hormone is important for the development and maintenance of hair follicles. Both under and overproduction of thyroid hormone can result in hair loss, but usually only if severe and prolonged,” Dr. Colaço tells us. Although, fortunately, she also says that “Hair loss is temporary and regrowth is expected with the treatment of the underlying thyroid disorder, although this may take several months.”PCOS: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common hormone disorder and while it usually causes excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), in some cases, although less common, PCOS can cause scalp hair loss. Dr. Colaço explains that “Since PCOS causes excess androgen activity, patients may experience female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Hairs lost due to PCOS will not grow back without treatment. The anti-androgen medication, spironolactone, is often prescribed in combination with oral contraceptive pills (also lowers androgens) with moderate success.” Find out more about polycystic ovary syndrome here.My experience with hair loss and how I fixed it:In most cases, traction alopecia can be avoided, as it’s caused by wearing tight hairstyles or styles – like weaves, extensions, and tight braids – that put significant stress on the hair follicles. Dr. Colaço explains that “The constant pulling on the hair shaft can result in permanent damage to the hair follicle and a type of hair loss called traction alopecia.”How to avoid traction alopecia: Dr. Colaço suggests that “If you are planning on getting weaves or extensions, opt for the sewn-in kind. Braided styles should be kept in for no more than two to three months.”Signs of traction alopecia and how to prevent it: “The first signs of hair thinning due to traction alopecia can be broken hairs at the front of your hairline, a receding hairline, or patchy hair loss where hair is tightly pulled. If you notice any of these signs, it goes without saying that you should stop pulling on your hair immediately to prevent scarring of the hair follicle and irreversible hair loss! Looser, natural hairstyles are the key to both treatment and prevention of traction alopecia,” Dr. Colaço warns.In fact, one of our lovely Huda Beauty team members experienced irreversible hair loss from traction alopecia due to scraping her hair back into a ponytail during her school years. She just recently underwent forehead reduction surgery to conceal the permanent loss of hair at the front of her scalp.“Bald patches are most commonly seen on the crown of the scalp in male pattern hair loss. There is also a condition called alopecia areata in which your own immune system attacks your hair follicles causing circular, patchy hair loss. Hair loss in alopecia areata is most often seen on the scalp, but can also occur in the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and other hair-bearing areas,” Dr. Colaço tells us. Dr. Avram also adds that “Chronic persistent traction alopecia can result in bald patches.”Causes: While doctors still don’t know exactly why this happens, genetics and stress are thought to be key factors.Treatments: Dr. Colaço says that “Although this is a self-limited condition, monthly corticosteroid injections by a dermatologist into the bald patches are very effective in reducing inflammation around the hair follicle and helping hair to regrow faster.”Hair loss has SO many different causes, so if you notice any unusual hair loss, it’s really important to see your doctor. The sooner you understand the problem, the sooner you can get started with a treatment plan or feel reassured that what you’re experiencing is only temporary.To determine the cause, Dr. Colaço explains, “A dermatologist will take a thorough history of the hair loss, including family history, check for signs of inflammation or infection, and order blood tests to investigate other possible causes of hair loss, including hypothyroidism and iron deficiency. If there are signs of excess androgen activity (such as menstrual irregularities, acne, and excess facial and body hair), a hormonal evaluation can be performed. A scalp biopsy is useful in some cases, especially if scarring alopecia is suspected.”My short-term hack for hiding thinning hair partings with eyeshadow:Once you and your doctor have determined what is causing your hair loss, your dermatologist will tell you if treatment is necessary or whether the hair may grow back by itself.Dr. Colaço outlines some of the most effective treatments for hair loss that can be combined for even better results:Minoxidil (Rogaine®): “The 5% solution is a safe and effective treatment for hair loss and it is the only topical treatment FDA-approved for female pattern hair loss. I recommend at least a nine-month trial before deciding whether or not it’s helping you and if it is, you must keep using it to maintain the benefit. If you stop using Rogaine, hair loss returns within a few months.” Dr Colaço also warns that you should avoid letting the solution drip onto areas other than the scalp, like your cheeks or forehead, to avoid any unwanted hair growth!Rogaine is definitely at the more affordable end of the spectrum; the Women’s Rogaine® 5% Minoxidil Unscented Foam costs $27.50.Laser for at-home use: “Red light therapy (RLT) or low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in theory could thicken hair follicles. One very small study revealed that people who received RLT had improved hair density compared with those in a placebo group, [however] only a few studies have looked at these devices, the results are promising and require as little as 20 minutes of use twice a week. The downside is that the devices are expensive, do not work for everyone, and more research needs to be done to see if new hair growth is sustainable in the long term.”In our experience, combining red light with derma-rolling and serums has helped to more quickly regrow hair on areas that have been damaged due to traction alopecia.Hair transplant: “If you have an area of thinning or balding due to male or female pattern hair loss, a hair transplant can be an effective and permanent solution. Keep in mind that hair transplants are very expensive, not covered by insurance, and not everyone is a good candidate.”Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections: “This in-office treatment has become very popular in recent years and for good reason! There is mounting scientific evidence to support that it is a safe and effective treatment for hair loss and also, as natural as it gets! PRP is obtained by drawing a small amount of your blood and using a machine to spin it down and isolate the platelets, which contain lots of your own natural growth factors. It is then injected back into your scalp at the level of the hair follicles in areas of hair loss. We recommend monthly injections for the first three to four months and then once every three to six months thereafter for maintenance.”  A post shared by SKINSTYLE DERMATOLOGY (@skinstylederm) on Nov 22, 2019 at 4:21pm PSTFinasteride (Propecia®) and dutasteride: “These medications are FDA approved to treat male pattern hair loss. I recommend at least a six-month trial before deciding whether or not it’s helping you and if it is, you must keep using it to maintain the benefit. In addition, finasteride and dutasteride are sometimes used off-label to treat hair loss in post-menopausal women.”Spironolactone: “For pre-menopausal women who have FPHL, this anti-androgen medication is often used. Studies have shown that ~40% of women who take this medication for a year will experience improvement in hair loss. As it can cause birth defects, an oral contraceptive pill is often prescribed with it.”Biotin, iron, protein, and/or zinc: “These supplements are recommended if your clinical history or blood tests reveal that you have deficiencies.”If treatment is needed, Dr. Colaço says “It’s important to remember that not one treatment works for all types of hair loss and often the best response is achieved by using multiple treatments. A positive response to treatment can be seen as new hair growth, thickening of existing hairs, and/or reduction of hair loss.”

The answer to this is yes and no, and some supplements are more effective than others. Iron supplements are only helpful for those who have iron deficiencies. For androgenic alopecia (male or female pattern hair loss) an oral anti-androgen like those listed above – finasteride, dutasteride, and spironolactone – are the most effective.However, if you don’t want to take oral medication, supplements can be helpful. Dr. Colaço suggests, “Look for ingredients like Biotin and Saw palmetto. Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for healthy hair and nails. Products should contain at least 2500 mcg of Biotin and no more than 5000mcg. Saw palmetto can block the hormone DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the active form of testosterone and the main target of anti-androgen medications like finasteride.“Nutrafol, which I use in my practice, is a nutraceutical product containing Biotin 3000 mcg and Saw Palmetto as well as other proprietary botanicals with potent anti-inflammatory, anti-stress, antioxidant, and DHT-inhibiting properties. A research study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Drugs in Dermatology showed statistically significant improvement in hair growth, density and quality, albeit in a small number of patients.”Source: Viviscal and NutrafolNutrafol supplements are another more affordable treatment for hair loss with some impressive science to back them up. A month’s worth of Nutrafol supplements cost $79, and you should stick with it for up to six months to see impressive results. We’re also big fans of the Viviscal hair supplements, which are also hugely popular among celebs and have extensive research and science-backed results. You can get a three-month subscription for $40 per month here.Unfortunately, Dr. Colaço told us “There are no specific natural ingredients or oils available for home use that have been clinically shown to grow hair on their own.”Dr. Colaço was kind enough to share her top tips for keeping your hair healthy at home:1. Gentle hair care: Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners. A conditioner that is too thick can weigh hair down and decrease volume.2. Limit heat: Try to limit use of hot tools or use the lowest heat settings: this includes hot-oil treatments, blow dryers, curling irons, straighteners etc.3. Limit chemical treatments: Coloring, perming, straightening, relaxing and other chemical treatments should be limited and preferably done by a professional.4. Avoid pulling: Wearing your hair in tight hairstyles (sleek buns, ponytails, braids, etc.) and use of extensions, weaves, etc can cause hair loss over time. Loose, natural hairstyles are safest.5. Stop smoking: Smoking causes inflammation throughout the body, which makes so many things worse, and hair loss is no exception.6. Eat healthy: Eating too few calories every day can cause hair loss and so can not getting enough nutrients, such as iron or protein.Let us know if you have any questions or stories you’d like to share in the comments below.

Actually, stress may be causing you to lose your hair. There are a number of factors that contribute to both hair and scalp health and visible hair loss.Hair loss can affect both men and women. While most treatments have historically targeted men, Harklinikken treats both men and women. Women typically notice hair loss sooner and seek treatment sooner, perhaps because receding hairlines, bald spots and baldness are more expected and accepted in men. We are sensitive to the effects of hair loss on our clients’ lives. Whether you suspect that your receding hair line is hereditary or are wondering why you’re shedding at an increasing rate, the question is, can it be reversed?Harklinikken categorizes hair loss into four basic types: Our environment and lifestyle play a significant role in hair thinning and hair loss. These can include:In fact, many of the products and techniques we use to cover our thinning hair can actually exacerbate hair loss. Extensions, for example, which are often used to quickly add volume and fullness, can cause scalp scarring over time. If you are noticing significant hair loss, it may be a sign of a behavioral, health or medical condition that needs to be addressed. Anyone experiencing hair thinning or hair loss should first see their doctor to rule out any medical issues. Some conditions that impact hair quality and quantity include: Chemotherapy for cancer treatment is not the only pharmaceutical cause of hair loss. The use of other medications can also cause hair to fall out. Be aware of whether or not a medication you're taking lists hair loss as a potential side effect. It's also important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before starting a drug treatment regimen or if you notice any changes during your treatment.The most common cause of hair loss is in your genes. If you’re wondering how your scalp will age, look no further than your own family tree. Heredity hair loss is often called male/female pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia. Almost as many women as men develop hereditary hair loss, but their hair loss patterns are often different. There are two types of heredity hair loss:In one of the more typical patterns of androgenic alopecia, some of the hair follicles actually shrink. As the follicles shrink, the quality of the hair strands growing from the follicles is reduced. This type of hair loss is most often associated with men; however, women also suffer from mild androgenic alopecia. In women, the pattern is usually sporadic rather than concentrated in one spot.This is a more serious stage of hereditary hair loss. In the advanced stage the hair follicles shrink so significantly that they can no longer sustain hair growth. Advanced androgenic alopecia is very common in men, who experience it to different degrees. Men who are less severely afflicted typically experience hair loss in particular areas, such as receding temples and/or the crown of their head. In severe cases of advanced androgenic alopecia, large areas of the scalp are affected by shrunken follicles. Men experiencing this type of androgenetic alopecia lose all (or most of) the hair on top of their head, but retain full, healthy hair around the sides. Before seeking treatment for hair loss, it is important to visit your doctor or dermatologist to determine the underlying cause of your condition. Ready for some help?

Not such an issue when we were mostly stuck in our homes, but now we are gradually seeing more people in person again we might want to start caring about our appearance again. Caring about our hair is not a trivial, vanity thing, it really affects our confidence, so I thought I’d share the following with you… If you’re waiting for your hair to regrow after losing it then it’s a good thing that it grows 2.5cm per week. Ironically though, you may be currently having problems because it is growing too much!The reality is that you can’t see your hairdresser to cut the ends of your hair or colour your growing natural coloured/grey roots. Many more men have given up shaving and now grown beards and as it’s fashionable that isn’t a problem, but they are complaining about unruly long hair, in these instances, I would recommend smoothing it back with a styling product like my hair serum! For women, though having a break from the hairdresser cutting too much off your hair can be a good thing if you want longer hair, but not if you have split ends, as it’s important to get those seen to as soon as possible, because they only get worse if left. It’s actually not that difficult though trimming the ends of your hair at home. I suggest following a YouTube video, just ensure you use ultra-sharp scissors and see your hairdresser next month to give you the professional makeover.Firstly, I must say I do believe having a break from dyeing hair for a few months is definitely a good thing for the health and strength of your hair! But rather than waiting for an appointment with your hairdresser, you may want to consider home dyeing as it’s actually really cheap & easy and you could always try a semi-permanent colour if not sure how the colour will turn out. I did some expert, media work for Naturtint many years ago, so I got to know the brand well and they are more natural, their reflex range is semi-permanent and significantly more  “Free From”. Like many things though hair dye is a very individual thing, so to let you into my secret; for me personally, I find I’m better with one with chemicals! In actual fact, it’s not produced anymore, but I can still get old stock from Amazon and it’s called Belle Colour from Garnier. Please don’t buy up the old stock of my colour as there won’t be anything left for me. I had a terrible reaction from their new products, luckily I could treat myself, but it does go to show you do need to be a little careful if you’re experimenting with dyeing your hair.If you are only seeing people a couple of times a week then it may be better to use just a root touch up, which you can just spray on and lasts until your next shampoo. The one I like is L’Oreal Magic Retouch, but if you’ve found something else you like then that’s ok. I don’t recommend retouching roots for daily use though, as it’s important to keep your hair and scalp as clean as possible. This leads me to the next issue, which is that if you are mostly still staying home you may not be washing your hair as often as normal, but contrary to what many believe it’s actually a good thing to wash your hair daily or at least every other day, to clean your scalp and hair, remove impurities such as sweat, dead skin cells and environmental toxins such as pollution or styling products. By keeping your follicles clean it promotes healthy hair growth and minimises excess shedding. My only caveats here are to use good quality shampoos and conditioners such as from my range and to minimise heat styling as much as possible, use your blowdryer on a cool setting or better yet in this weather you can leave to dry naturally.If you are having any hair loss issues, you don’t need to wait until the government permits face to face consultations as during this lockdown period I’m delighted that the Institute of Trichologists has lifted their ban on video consultations, it’s something that I’ve wanted them to do for many years, as for the way I conduct my consultations, with blood tests, etc., video is in the majority of cases perfectly sufficient. We have some special rates for these if you want to check them out on the website. Many prefer to wait to see me in person though, that’s totally understandable and I look forward to restarting these myself!In the meantime please remember if you need improvement to the condition, pigmentation or thickness of your hair then take my award-winning Hair Today More Tomorrow, M & O’s. I’m sorry though for the unprecedented caution that it could make your hair grow faster!Please also check out my shop for quality shampoos and conditioners, etc.Take care,

23,https://www.healthline.com/health/hair-loss-prevention#1,"There are many things you can do to slow or stop hair loss. But what to do depends on the reason why you’re losing your hair.Some situations, like hair loss after pregnancy (telogen effluvium), may resolve on their own. And remember that everyone sheds hair daily, which is perfectly normal.It’s when hair loss is persistent that you want to see your doctor. Your healthcare provider may be able to diagnose if your hair loss is caused by things like thyroid issues, stress, scalp infections, androgenic alopecia, or simply aging.A 2018 study revealed that a diet containing raw vegetables and fresh herbs, like the Mediterranean diet, may reduce the risk of androgenic alopecia (female pattern baldness or male pattern baldness) or slow its onset. Best results were observed when participants consumed high amounts of these foods — such as parsley, basil, salad greens — more than three days a week.Hair follicles are made mostly of protein called keratin. One 2017 study of 100 people with hair loss noted several nutritional deficiencies in participants, including amino acids that serve as the building blocks of protein.While researchers note that more studies are needed, eating a diet rich in protein may help prevent hair loss. Healthy choices include foods like eggs, nuts, beans and peas, fish, low-fat dairy products, chicken, and turkey.Vitamin A is composed in part of retinoids, which has been shown to increase the rate of hair growth. This vitamin may also help with sebum production, keeping the scalp healthier and able to retain more hairs. Fill your plate with foods rich in vitamin A, such as sweet potatoes, sweet peppers, and spinach, just to name a few. Read this for more foods that help hair growth: 14 Best Foods for Hair Growth.Scientists have determined that vitamins A, B, C, D, iron, selenium, and zinc are all important to the hair growth and retention processes, specifically with cell turnover. You can find daily multivitamins at most grocery stores or drugstores or ask your doctor to prescribe one to you. Shop for multivitamins online..One 2018 study noted that vitamin D is associated with nonscarring alopecia. Treating deficiencies may help with regrowth. Speak with your doctor about taking 800 to 1000 IU daily.Shop for vitamin D.Biotin — vitamin H or B7— is involved in fatty acid synthesis in the body. This process is essential to the hair life cycle and you may experience hair loss if you have a deficiency. Speak with your doctor about taking three to five milligrams daily.Shop for biotin.Derived from the fruit of American dwarf pine trees, this herb may help men maintain levels of testosterone. One 2004 journal article revealed that some 60 percent of participants taking saw palmetto experienced improved hair growth. The dosage in the study was 200 milligrams daily.Shop for saw palmetto.Ginseng contains certain phytochemicals that may promote hair growth on the scalp. Further study is needed to recommend specific dosages. In the meantime, speak with your doctor about taking ginseng supplements or consider trying topical solutions that contain this ingredient. Shop for ginseng.Washing hair daily may protect against hair loss by keeping the scalp healthy and clean. The key is to use a mild shampoo. Harsher formulas may dry hair and cause it to break, leading to hair loss.Shop for mild shampoo.According to a 2018 review of studies, researchers believe that coconut oil may help prevent hair damage from grooming and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.Lauric acid found in coconut oil helps bind protein in hair, protecting it from breakage at the root and strand. Massaging coconut oil into the scalp may promote better blood flow and help with regrowth.Shop for coconut oil.Olive oil can be used to deep condition hair, protecting it from dryness and associated breakage. Olive oil is also a central ingredient to the Mediterranean diet, which may help slow genetic hair loss. Consider applying a couple tablespoons of olive oil directly to hair and letting it sit for 30 minutes before washing out. Shop for olive oil.Skip tight braids or ponytails that may pull on hair at the root and potentially lead to excessive shedding. While you’re at it, let your hair air dry to avoid irritating your scalp. Heat stylers, like curling or straightening irons, may also damage or break the hair shaft.Chemical treatments, like perms or hair color, may also damage hair and scalp. Ask your stylist about alternatives, like organic hair dyes and others that don’t contain ammonia, peroxide, or para-phenylenediamine (PPD).Low-level lasers may help improve hair density for people with genetic hair loss and loss due to chemotherapy. This option is also called red light therapy, and it may work by stimulating epidermal stem cells. You can find home laser devices for between $200 to $600. It may take many treatments to see results.Shop for home laser devices.Injecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the scalp helps stimulate growth in areas already impacted by hair loss. Blood is run through a centrifuge to separate out the platelets and then injected into the scalp.In one 2017 study, 11 participants saw 30 percent more growth in thinning areas after four sessions. Each session costs between $500 and $1000, according to the Cleveland Clinic, and is not covered by insurance.Otherwise known as Rogaine, this over-the-counter (OTC) drug is known to work for around two-thirds of women who try it, according to the Mayo Clinic. Apply the liquid or foam to your scalp each day. Side effects include scalp irritation and acne at the site of application. Rarer side effects include irregular heartbeat and blurred vision. Shop for minoxidil.Otherwise known as Propecia, this prescription pill may help slow hair loss and even promote new growth. It is approved for men and works better for men under the age of 60, according to the Mayo Clinic. Women who are or who may become pregnant should avoid this medication.Topical phenylephrine may help with hair loss due to styling by stimulating the follicle muscles to contract. This makes it harder to pull out hairs during brushing, for example. Unfortunately, you’ll need to keep an eye out for this medical solution. Scientists have developed a specific formula called AB&dash102, but it has not yet been released to the public.Essential oils may help reduce hair loss. A 1998 study divided 86 people with alopecia areata into two groups, one of which cedarwood oil mixed with lavender and rosemary into their scalps. After seven months, 43 percent of that group showed improvement in their condition.Other essential oils to consider include lavender, lemongrass, and peppermint. Try mixing couple drops of any or all of these oils with a couple tablespoons of carrier oil, like jojoba or grapeseed, and apply to the scalp for 10 minutes before washing.Shop for essential oils.People with alopecia areata may see regrowth after applying crude onion juice to their scalps twice a day. While research on this treatment is limited, the juice did appear to promote growth in nearly 87 percent of participants in a small 2014 study. How does it work? Scientists believe the magic lies in the onion’s sulphur content. Shop for onion juice.We know scalp massage feels good, but can it help grow your hair, too? Maybe.One small 2016 study showed participants seeing results with as little as four minutes of massage a day over the course of 24 weeks.Shop for a scalp massager.Hair loss caused by stress may respond well to yoga. Try these stress-relieving yoga poses to prevent and slow hair loss: Downward Facing Dog, Forward Bend, Camel Pose, Shoulder Stand, Fish Pose, and Kneeling Pose. You can find a flow through these poses for free on YouTube.The hair on your head goes through a life cycle that involves growth, resting, and shedding. It’s common for people to lose around 100 hairs a day. If you experience more sudden loss, loss in patches, or overall thinning, you may want to see your doctor. Some shedding is temporary and may respond well to changes in diet, certain treatments, or lifestyle changes. Other loss may be more permanent or not stop until an underlying condition is treated.By age 40, about half of all men will experience hair loss due to hereditary conditions like androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). Likewise, more than half of women will experience genetic hair loss (female pattern baldness) before the age of 70. Other causes of hair loss include:Consider making an appointment to see your doctor if you are experiencing sudden or extreme hair loss. Some conditions, like thyroid issues, may not respond to home remedies and require treatment of the underlying causes. Also keep in mind that any treatment you use may take anywhere from six months to a year to show improvement on areas where hair loss has already occurred.

World-renowned trichologist PHILIP KINGSLEY says that the human hair has the second fastest growing cells in our body- intestinal cells being the first.Our hair reflects our overall health. For well-nurtured hair- here are the must-haves for a regular diet:Your scalp (like your skin) can get dry. You should drink about 1.5-2 litres of water.Hair is protein-based, so taking in more protein is essential. A serving of 120g of meat protein (for breakfast and lunch) is recommended. For vegetarians- you’ll want to go over 120g of plant-based sources such as nuts, beans, legumes and tofu.Rich sources of biotin: salmon, oysters, avocados and nuts.Vitamin c (a resource or producing collagen) is needed for healthy hair and skin. It plays an important role as a major antioxidant that “fights off all of the cellular damage we’re doing regularly”. Citrus fruits, sweet potatoes and red peppers are the top sources of vit c.Never underestimate the importance of a nutritious breakfast. It’s the refueling point for most of your body- including your scalp and hair follicles. A meal that’s complete with all of the above provides much needed energy to form hair cells.Try not to shower with chilly water- or at least try not to use it on your scalp. REASON: 1. Cooler temperatures may constrict the capillaries on your scalp that “carry nutrients and pick up waste products from the skin’s surface” 2. To stay on the safe side – USE LUKEWARM WATER when starting off.1. It’s not advisable to shampoo your hair every single day. It causes the hair to become drier and more brittle. 2. It is better to do alternate day depending the hair or scalp condition (like oily) with mild shampoo. 3. A good conditioner helps to maintain the ends of the hair, minimizes the risk of tangles, split ends and breakage. NOTE: Conditioners with waxes are not recommended- they can make your look thin and dull.1. It’s best not to subject your hair to pulling or stretching whenever in its wettest state. REASON: It’s most vulnerable to split ends or breaking off. 2. Better to dry with a towel before you gently use a comb or brush. No quick rubbing back and forth.1. Cells rely on oxygen to duplicate and stay healthy. Oxygen reaches every cell through a fully operational blood circulation. 2. A half an hour cardio workout (like running or jogging or walking in the morning and evening) is good for not only to hair but also to whole body. 3. Along with that make it a habit to massage your scalp from time to time. It helps shake up the hair cells into a slightly more vigorous state.1. About 7-8 hours of sleep every night is ideal. REASON: It is the state where the body is in constant repair mode. It also acts as a window for growth hormone to come out and speed up cell reproduction. MORE SLEEP = MORE ACTIVE SCALP CELLS = MORE HAIR1. A stressed state of mind is as big of a factor as the lack of physical health. The more you stress yourself out- the more it can burden your brain 2. The goal is to worry less. You can try going out for a run or watching comedy on tv and spend time with your beloved friends and family members.Most of the factors that control hair growth are out of our day to day control. The best step you can take is to prevent hair loss and thinning due to poor nutrition. Be sure to eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated. Check in with your doctor if you feel that you are experiencing significant hair loss. Embrace a healthy lifestyle and your scalp can work its magic. Be patient …and you’ll soon get the desired length or even more.

                  Posted by Kalyani Hari on May 22, 2020
Our blog posts contain information that are both scientifically accurate, as well as stay true to the principles of Ancient Ayurveda.They are written after extensive research of Ayurvedic texts and are medically reviewed by our Ayurvedic doctor.The articles consist of references to reputed Ayurvedic books and scientific research papers, which can be visited by clicking the numbers in the parentheses.Every time you see a bulk of your frail hair strands tangling in the hairbrush, it terrorizes you, right? We know exactly how you feel. With most hair products in the market being chemical-leached or adulterated, how can you deal with it safely?Thankfully, the great Indian sages have left us with their incredible wisdom of Ayurveda! "" We have a plethora of healing therapies and herbal formulations along with holistic health routines in Ayurveda. It offers you powerful and natural remedies to strengthen your innate hair growth competence without side effects"" says Dr.Zeel, Chief Ayurvedic Doctor at Vedix.So, let’s understand how you can regrow your lost hair and maintain its strength with the help of Ayurveda.Highlights:The Ayurvedic system is based on the concept of keeping the three dosha levels - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in balance. According to Ayurveda, hair fall occurs when there is an imbalance in these doshas, which form your innate Prakriti. Thus, in order to reverse hair loss, you need to work upon balancing your Ayurvedic doshas.""But, to achieve and maintain such a balanced state of dosha levels, you must take a vow of consistency in Ayurveda. Ayurveda is not just about curing illnesses, but also a lifestyle that prevents the occurrence of illnesses,"" says Dr. Zeel.Below are the fundamental aspects responsible for dosha imbalances in your body:When your diet lacks essential nutrients [1] like Vitamin A, B, C, D, E, and K along with iron, magnesium, zinc, protein, etc., it leads to the elevation of Vata dosha in your body, leading to hair fall and hair loss.Pitta levels in the body spike up when you undergo severe emotional and physical stress. When you are stressful and anxious, your body secretes excessive hormones to prepare itself to combat any potential threat it assumes to receive.These sudden hormonal changes in the body affect hair growth. Unless it is a life-threatening situation, it is not good for your body to undergo stress-related hormonal changes.If factors like toxic or polluted environments, alcohol, smoking, etc., are part of your lifestyle, then you may have severe hair loss due to the build-up of excess oxidative stress in your body.Smoking can even damage your DNA and speeds up the hair fall condition. Hence, individuals, especially with genetic baldness, are highly recommended to avoid poor lifestyle choices to prevent faster hair loss.Your hair cells are the second fastest-growing cells in your body, after your intestinal cells. However, your body does not prioritize the high energy needs of hair as it comes under the category of non-essential tissues (unlike your liver or kidneys). Therefore, it is crucial to support your hair with regular maintenance, a healthy diet, and a lifestyle for stronger hair growth.In Shirodhara, warm oils or liquids formulated with soothing Ayurvedic herbal ingredients are poured on your forehead from an oscillating container hung above. While the medicated liquid or oil travels down from the forehead to your scalp, the therapist gives a gentle massage on your scalp. This has an immensely soothing and cleansing effect on your nervous system.Shirodhara therapy is exceptionally beneficial to balance Vata and Pitta doshas in the body. Besides decreasing your hair loss, Shirodhara has a calming effect on your mind. It reduces stress, induces sleep, regulates fluctuations in blood pressure, and relieves you from migraines.Shiro abhyanga involves massaging the head, neck, upper back and shoulders with warm Ayurvedic oils. It is a therapy to relieve stress from muscles and tissues in your upper body along with your scalp. According to Yogic science, Shiroabhyanga balances the three upper chakras - Anja (between eyebrows), Sahasrara (top of head) and Vishuddha (in the throat).The warm medicated oils are gently poured on the area of action and massage is given by various kinds of hand movements to stimulate pressure points in that area. The head massage in Shiroabhyanga enhances the flow of oxygen and blood into your scalp, thus, ensuring nutrient supply to your follicles. A regular Shiroabhyanga promotes healthy nourishment to your hair.In Shirolepa, different Ayurvedic herbs in dry powdered form are mixed into a fine paste as per powerful Ayurvedic formulations in ancient texts. After applying this paste thoroughly, your scalp is covered with banana leaf, leaving the top portion of the scalp, from where a medicated Ayurvedic oil is poured on to the lepa. This enhances the interaction of medicinal paste with the deeper scalp tissues.Shiro Lepa is best used to pacify Pitta dosha and is extremely beneficial in treating premature greying, hair fall, and dandruff. Besides balancing aggravated doshas and providing nourishment to your hair follicles, Shiro Lepa relieves you from the issues of headache, the heaviness of head and stress.Ayurveda suggests Nasya [2] as one of the best therapy for hair loss related to the imbalance in tridoshas. The practice of lubricating your Nasal passages with Ayurvedic herbal oils is called 'Nasya' Kriya.In Nasya kriya, you need to lie down horizontally and slightly tilt your head backward. Few oil drops are instilled into the nostrils and allowed to hit the back of your throat internally. Practicing Nasya in the morning is best to treat Kapha related problems, afternoon for Pitta disorders, and evening to relieve Vata disorders. Nasya also aids in enhancing immunity by strengthening the mucosal pathway and clearing your sinuses.You can perform Nasya at home every day with Sesame oil. It has a warming and calming properties that help in balancing your nervous system. Also, you can use Brahmi Ghee for treating elevated Pitta dosha, Tikta Ghee for pacifying Vata or Pitta doshas, and Vacha oil for treating imbalanced Vata or Kapha doshas.While your busy lifestyle and tight schedules make it difficult for you to take regular therapies of Shirodhara and Shiroabhyanga, you can adopt regular scalp massages with Ayurvedic oils at home to keep your doshas in balance. All you need to do is gently massage your scalp for about 15 minutes with pure Ayurvedic hair oil.This stimulates your blood vessels and enhances blood circulation in your scalp. You can use hair oils with medicinal herbs specific to your elevated dosha, which soaks into your scalp tissues and heals the specific scalp disorders caused by imbalanced doshas. Thus, you can successfully prevent hair loss with regular oiling and scalp massages.At Vedix, we formulate customized Ayurvedic hair oils by evaluating your dosha levels. Ideally, you need to massage your scalp at least twice or thrice in a week. Ayurveda suggests giving a scalp massage a night before you plan your hair wash. This gives your scalp and hair a conditioning effect. Oils Used For Scalp Massaging Sesame oil, Coconut oil, Amla oil, Almond oil, Olive oil, Neem oil, Brahmi oil, and Bhringraj oil are some of the commonly used hair oils to promote hair regrowth.If you don't clean your hair regularly, the oils secreted and external pollutants clog your hair follicles, which leads to scalp irritation, itching, and hair fall. For best results, avoid chemical-free shampoos and start using Ayurvedic herbal shampoos which are mild.You can also use natural Ayurvedic herbal solutions as hair cleansers, which boosts your hair growth by providing nourishment to your scalp besides cleaning action. It is best to have hair wash at least twice or thrice in a week to keep the scalp clean and healthy. Ayurvedic Herbs Used As Hair Cleansers Shikakai (Soap Pod), Reetha (Soap Nut), Triphala (Haritaki+Bibhitaki+Amalaki), Kumari (Aloe vera), Amla (Indian Gooseberry), Japa (Hibiscus), Methi (Fenugreek), Nimba(Neem), etc. are some of the commonly used Ayurvedic ingredients for Hair cleansing. Ayurvedic Herbs For Hair Regrowth Below are some of the most commonly used herbs you can seek as ingredients in the above mentioned topical Ayurvedic treatments for hair regrowth.a. Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri)b. Bhringraj (Eclipta Prostrata or Eclipta Alba)c. Kumari (Aloe Vera)d. Ashwagandha (Indian Ginseng)e. Japa (Hibiscus)d. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)According to Ayurveda, a wholesome diet that is rich in essential vitamins and minerals for hair growth plays a crucial role in keeping your doshas in balance and maintaining hair health.Below are a few nutrient-rich foods that Ayurveda suggests for healthy hair regrowth. Ensure you consume them regularly based on the status of your dosha levels.Cucumber contains vitamin A, Vitamin C and silica, which helps in hair regrowth. It aids in pacifying the increased Vata and Pitta doshas in your body and promotes healthy hair growth with a soft texture.Pumpkin contains essential minerals for hair growth like Potassium and Zinc. While potassium enhances regrowth of hair by activating your follicles, Zinc [3] helps in maintaining the collagen levels on your scalp and strengthens your hair roots. It is ideal in treating Vata and Pitta related hair loss.Leafy vegetables like Collards, Spinach, Kale, etc are rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and iron, which are essential for healthy hair growth. Most of the leafy vegetables help to pacify all the three doshas in the body.Yogurt has been known as one of the best hair care ingredients since ancient times. It is rich in lactic acid that helps in repairing hair with aggravated Vata related problems like dry and damaged hair. Also, it contains multiple vitamins required for stronger hair regrowth.Peppermint [4] acts as a vasodilator in the body that enhances your blood circulation. Unless you have proper blood circulation in your scalp, the follicles do not receive nutrients you consume through your diet. Lack of blood circulation due to Pitta imbalance is one of the most common reasons for hair loss.Coriander contains iron, magnesium, and manganese along with Vitamin C, Vitamin K, and protein. Include coriander in your everyday diet to combat hair fall and support your follicles to regrow healthy hair.Below are the most commonly prescribed Ayurvedic medications for hair regrowth: Important Note: You need to consume all Ayurvedic medications under the guidance of your Ayurvedic doctor only.Take out time every day for your exercise regimen. Besides helping you stay fit, regular exercising enhances blood circulation and muscle functioning. In turn, it boosts your overall health and keeps your hair healthy.You can also adopt stress-relieving practices like pranayama and yoga, which can soothe your nervous system. While Pranayama helps you in detoxifying and restoring mental balance, yoga helps you achieve overall physical and mental well being. Also, Ayurveda bestows different yoga routines [5] to calm down specific dosha imbalances in your body.According to Ayurveda, your sleep cycle is one of the most important factors in maintaining your dosha levels in equilibrium. Your body systems undergo reparations and reorganization when you are asleep. During sleep, stem cell activity [6] on the scalp gets triggered to generate epithelial cells for hair growth.Irregular and insufficient sleep causes disturbance in your body clock and leads to its inefficient functioning due to stress build-up. Six hours of sound sleep from 10:00 pm to 4.00 am is what Ayurveda suggests to maintain your body and dosha levels in balance. Note: The above treatments may not be very helpful when the hair loss is due to a genetic disorder.You may also experience hair loss if you have skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, etc. In such cases, your doctor may prescribe you specific medicated hair creams, oils and shampoos to heal your scalp. Dr. Zeel recommends using sulfate-free shampoos. ""Shampoos that contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate [7] and Sodium Laureth Sulfate dry up the natural oils on your scalp and this may eventually cause hair loss,"" she says.Minoxidil and Propecia are the most popular drugs used in hair growth treatments. Minoxidil is also available as a topical solution. However, it is advised to intake these drugs only under the guidance of an experienced doctor.Laser treatment [8] is less invasive than hair transplantation and helps in stimulating blood circulation on your scalp. Although it is a painless process, it may not be effective for people who have hair loss in advanced stages.It can be ideal for people who have genetic baldness or injured scalp. There are two types of hair transplantation surgeries [9] you can opt based on your hair loss stage- Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). Note: Hair transplantation is not recommended if the hair loss is due to chemotherapy.The first and most important aspect you need to remember is that you should never self-prescribe any medication, whether it is Ayurvedic or Allopathic. The consequences of using Ayurvedic and Allopathic medications simultaneously depends upon your medical requirements. It is highly recommended to consult your Allopathic doctor as well as an Ayurvedic practitioner and let them know about your medical history.This helps the doctors examine if you are allergic to any ingredients or identify any medicine combinations that need to be avoided. In general, as Ayurveda deals with natural herbs, they should not be clashing with other forms of medical drugs. But, in situations that demand immediate medical intervention, you need to check with your doctor if you need to have only chemical medications. The Last Word Whether you choose topical therapies or a more general approach with diet and lifestyle regimens, Ayurveda involves a holistic and intrinsic approach in treating your hair loss problems by addressing the root cause. Based on your current dosha levels, Vedix helps you to incorporate the most effective hair care regimen with natural Ayurvedic products customized for your hair.1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315033/2. https://www.adpublication.org/UploadFiles/PublishPaper/pJ7bNRmmfmw=/mEqs55Qp4bs=/v2i2-2.pdf3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/74665824. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289931/5. https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/yoga/health-and-wellness/yoga-for-hair-loss6. https://dev.biologists.org/content/141/16/31057. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691938/9. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825128/ You Might Also Like Was this Article helpful?Thank you for your feedback on this article. +91 40714 34363(9AM - 6PM, Mon - Sat) support@vedix.com",6.35,9.13,3.39,8.95,3.93,2310
27,https://www.allure.com/story/hair-loss-guide-women-causes-regrowth-treatments,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.To revisit this article, select My Account, thenView saved storiesBy Ivana RihterI was in the shower when I first noticed the nest of hair in the drain. When I saw the clumps entangled between my fingers, I knew something was wrong. It was all over my pillow. At first, I assured myself it was a one-time scare that was caused by shampooing too much. But after weeks of losing what felt like half of my thick head of curly hair, I started to panic.Hair loss is more common than you might think. According to the American Hair Loss Association, women make up to 40 percent of those who experience hair loss in the U.S. When I finally went to see a doctor, I found out that the cause of my thinning was due to a switch in birth control, which has thrown my hormones off. At that point, it had been months of stress and worry, and now I realize I should have gone to see a medical professional much sooner. In my case and the cases of so many women, hair loss can actually act as a warning sign for underlying medical issues. It is important to be attuned to what is happening with your hair because it can be indicative of your hormones, your thyroid, your metabolism, and your overall health.We sat down with prominent dermatologist Dr. Michelle Henry to break down stigmas and myths about skin and scalp care for brown skin.“There are many different reasons for hair loss, and hair loss may be a symptom of a greater problem,"" New York-based board-certified dermatologist Michelle Henry tells Allure. ""If someone has thyroid problems, it's really important to pinpoint this because this derangement in their metabolism can affect their overall health. If someone has iron deficiency anemia, one of their first manifestations may be hair loss."" The sooner these conditions are found, the better.Hair loss is nothing to hide or feel ashamed about, especially when it can give us clues about what is happening with our health and well being. Some women may not even be aware of their hormonal or thyroid issues until they go to the dermatologist looking to be treated for hair loss. To get an in-depth understanding of the different types of hair loss and possible reasons behind it, we went to the experts.If you are noticing a sudden lack of hair on your head, that is saying something already. ""It's pretty normal to lose between 50 to 100 or a little bit above 100 hairs a day,"" says Henry. ""Much more than that becomes concerning, and that's really important to let your dermatologist know.""Just as you would pay attention to a suspicious mole or keep your eye on a rash, it is important to take note of what is happening with your hair. Henry recommends a hair count test where you count every single hair you lose per day to gauge if what you are experiencing is normal or veering into something concerning.Despite what you may have been led to believe, not all hair loss looks the same. Identifying exactly what type you are experiencing can help you get to the bottom of the problem.The most common cause of hair loss, known as male-pattern baldness or female-pattern baldness, is hereditary and usually occurs gradually as you get older. You might notice a receding hairline, thinning hair, or bald spots. If you are noticing thinning at the temples and in the hairline, that is a sign the follicle is affected. In that case, it would be time to see a dermatologist who can screen for any underlying issues like iron deficiency or hormonal imbalances.""If the hair loss is slow and gradual and there is a family history, one can assume that it might be female-pattern hair loss,"" says Henry. ""If the hair loss begins a few months post-pregnancy, then it is fair to assume that this is a telogen effluvium due to pregnancy.” A dermatologist can take a look at your scalp, administer blood tests, and talk to you about your symptoms.Despite being panic-inducing, shedding is rather common after physical traumas, such as childbirth or surgery. Others might experience it after emotional traumas or periods of intense stress. Something as seemingly inconsequential as changing your birth control brand can also take a toll on your body and throw off your internal balance enough that hair loss follows.If you've been going through a rough patch in life lately and shedding seems to be the culprit, there's actually some good news: All the hair you shed can come back. Focus on your mental health, take care of your body, and make a point of managing your stress levels, and the period of shedding will likely go away on its own. ""With women especially, stress and the stress hormone — cortisol — is a huge contributor, especially chronic stress as it can disrupt hormonal balances and lead to disruption of the hair-growth cycle, as well as inflammation,” explains Sophia Kogan, co-founder and chief medical advisor of Nutrafol.If you find your hair is breaking in the middle of the strand or a few inches away from the scalp, that is a sign of weakened keratin and breakage due to severe damage to the hair protein — not traditional hair loss. In this case, give your hair a rest and swear off heat, bleach, and dye until you see some grow-out on the broken pieces and an overall improvement in hair texture.With conditions like alopecia areata and alopecia universalis, hair loss is caused when the immune system attacks the hair follicle. This type of hair loss is often sudden, and you'll notice one or more circular bald patches. It is common to have recurrences of the condition, and a small percentage of people who develop alopecia will experience eyelash and eyebrow hair loss on top of total scalp baldness, though they may not experience all these symptoms. This is a chronic condition, and the sooner it is diagnosed, the sooner you can figure out the next steps.Hair loss itself is sometimes treated as a diagnosis, but it is often asymptom of something bigger. ""Hair loss can be a sign of an underlying health issue and act as an early warning system,"" says Richard Firshein, an expert in integrative and precision-based medicine and founder of the Firshein Center. ""The health of hair follicles is directly related to health and the functioning of our endocrine system.""For conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is often difficult to diagnose, hair thinning is often one of the first tell-tale signs along with acne and body hair caused by the increased levels of testosterone. ""Patients with PCOS can have overall elevated testosterone leading to androgenetic alopecia,"" explains Henry. Talking about it openly with your dermatologist, OB-GYN, or general health provider can help get you to a diagnosis and treatment plan earlier.""Both hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can cause hair loss,"" explains Henry, who says an important part of her hair-loss blood panel is to check the TSH, which is a screening test for both conditions. Hair loss can alert us to everything from hormonal imbalances to nutritional deficiencies; Henry also mentions that iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, or vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause hair loss. The throughline is listening to one's body when something feels wrong. Take note of the hair loss and any other symptoms and ask your doctor or dermatologist for a comprehensive blood test — do not be afraid to advocate for yourself.If you find yourself hyperventilating in the aisles of Whole Foods and buying $70 worth of biotin, take a step back. Though its use as a hair- and nail-growth supplement is prevalent, research demonstrating the efficacy of biotin is limited and most has focused on nails. ""We don't really have great data supporting its use,"" says Henry. ""The original studies on biotin and hair were actually quite small; because of this, I don't recommend very high doses of biotin. Further, high doses of biotin can interfere with some blood tests, especially in older patients and patients with a history of heart disease.""Many women may have had these supplements recommended to them at some point, but unless there is a severe natural deficiency (which is very rare), it's typically preferable to incorporate proven lifestyle changes, like a nutrient-filled diet and decreased stress.There are a few treatments, like platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, that do work. ""PRP contains a number of compounds that are unique to platelets that stimulate growth and reduce inflammation,"" explains Firshein. ""Platelets work similarly to how they do in other parts of the body by repairing damaged areas and helping them to regrow.""If you are looking to improve the overall quality of your hair and get some thickness back, there are also botanical-based treatments like Nutrafol, which are supplements that contain curcumin, turmeric, ashwagandha (a stress adaptogen), and saw palmetto, a DHT rebalancer. Natural ingredients, such as vitamin B5 and rosemary oil, have also been proven to help thinning hair.With cases that are stress-related or due to overprocessing treatments like bleaching, your hair will come back — the best thing you can do is be patient and maybe buy some flyaway-controlling products to keep stragglers in check. In the case of hormone-related hair loss, go to a doctor and ask for blood work to get a full picture of what might be causing it. You may feel like you're overreacting, but there's no harm in getting reassurance that all of your important internal systems are healthy and functioning properly. Too often, the reason women do not seek treatment is that they are not taken seriously or do not want to burden providers with their concerns. For the record: Your concerns are valid, and hair loss is connected to so many hormonal and autoimmune conditions that it's worth the checkup.On top of stressing about medical intervention, there's the added stigma around women’s hair loss that makes women feel embarrassed or nervous to talk about it openly. ""We're used to talking about hair loss in men, but in women, it has been a subject that is surrounded by shame,"" says Kogan. ""We know that we will age, get wrinkles, our bodies will change, but no one ever told us that our hair will change as well as we get older.""Hair loss is incredibly common, and women should not have to suffer in silence or try to hide their hair loss for fear of being seen as unattractive or old. Aging is a natural and beautiful process, and whether it's going gray or thinning out, it is time we normalize beauty at every age.And now, some tips for caring for thinning hair:Now, watch Olivia Munn try nine things she's never done before:You can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.More from Allure© 2021 Condé Nast.

If you are tired of seeing strands of hair on your brush and around the shower drain, here are a few remedies that can help.As mentioned earlier, the causes of hair fall are many. Some of the most common causes are hormonal changes, genetics, stress, an unhealthy diet, etc. These factors, coupled with our fast-paced lifestyle and unhealthy habits lead to hair fall becoming an increasingly problematic issue among more and more people.This is the most common symptom of hair fall, where a woman's hair partition starts to become broader a lot more visible. Plus when the hair is tied, the scalp underneath is clearly visible.While this condition is a lot more common men, a lot of women suffer from it as well. Patchy hair loss is when a part of the scalp is completely visible and there is no hair growth in the area.Hair thinning is a common condition that follows physical or mental trauma. This is the condition where one starts to lose hair rapidly in a large number, especially when combing, waking up in the morning, or during hair wash.A scalp that’s dry with hair that lacks lustre is more prone to experience hair fall. Therefore, if you are looking for a solution to stop hair fall, it starts with the health of your scalp. If your scalp is dry, flaky or you have dandruff, first address and fix that problem. You can do this by regularly massaging your scalp with warm oil.

To nurse your hair follicles back to health, you can use coconut oil or even coconut milk. Massage the milk of coconut to your roots and let sit for 10 minutes before washing it. Coconut milk will reverse dryness and make your tresses smooth and shiny.How often to use - Once a weekAnother reason for hair fall, apart from dryness, could be clogged hair follicles.

From now on, the name of the game is to keep as much of that stuff on your head. (And to maintain its luster, strength, and shine.)Although the causes of hair loss are many — including genetics, age, hormones, nutrient deficiencies, toxicity, medications, and autoimmunity — changing your diet can, in many cases, be helpful. ""Proper diet and supplements can slow or reverse hair loss, and make the hair thicker and healthier,"" says nutritionist Joseph Debé, DC, CDN, CCSP.Below are 17 nutrient-rich foods that have been shown to keep hair healthy and full. And while we're on the subject of aging, you won't want to miss our exclusive report: 30 Foods You Should Never Eat After Age 30.In some cases (particularly in women), a mineral deficiency is the cause of hair loss. ""It's important to make sure you don't have a lack of something in your diet that could be leading to hair loss,"" says dermatologist Carolyn Jacob, MD, FAAD. ""We check protein levels, iron, iron storage, vitamin D and a number of other labs to make sure you don't have deficiencies.""Spinach is iron rich and it contains sebum, which acts as a natural conditioner for hair. The leafy green also provides omega-3 acids, magnesium, potassium, calcium, and iron. All help keep hair lustrous, shiny and, most importantly, out of the drain.STAY INFORMED: Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest food news delivered straight to your inbox.Sunflower seeds are rich in vitamin B5 (known as pantothenic acid), which helps with blood flow to your scalp and hair growth. According to a Clinical and Experimental Dermatology report, pantothenic acid deficiencies have been identified as a nutrient connected to hair loss. Just one ounce of the seeds serves up a solid 20 percent of your DV of the vitamin.The human body can do a lot of crazy stuff, like turning sunlight into bone-strengthening vitamin D. Something it can't do, however, is make omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to helping you stay fit and disease free, omega-3's enable you to grow hair and keep it shiny and full.""Omega-3's are anti-inflammatory. They can help if you have inflammation that's causing hair shedding,"" says Dr. Jacob. It's best to get omega-3s from natural sources, such as salmon and cold-water fish like sardines and mackerel.RELATED: Your guide to the anti-inflammatory diet that heals your gut, slows the signs of aging, and helps you lose weight.This ruby red root is rich in natural chemicals known as nitrates. After being broken down in your body, these chemicals may contribute to improved circulation, according to a British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology study, which may bring oxygen and nutrients to your hair follicles.Oats are rich in beta-glucans, a type of soluble fiber. According to Dr. Debé, both male-pattern balding and female hair loss is often associated with insulin resistance. Due to its high concentration of fiber, oatmeal is one food that helps improve the body's insulin sensitivity.An Annals of Dermatology study discovered that one type of polyunsaturated fatty acids—an omega-6 fatty acid known as arachidonic acid (AA)—can stimulate hair growth, making it thick and healthy. According to the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), chicken is the top source of AA intake in America. A 1-cup serving of a roasted chicken contains 154 milligrams of arachidonic acid.
Vitamin C prevents hair from becoming brittle and breaking. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled 2012 study published in the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, researchers tested an oral supplement containing vitamin C in women with thinning hair. They found the supplement promoted ""significant hair growth in women with temporary hair thinning."" Although we often think of oranges as the best source of vitamin C, just a half of a medium red bell pepper packs 158 percent of your DV of the nutrient. We've rounded up 6 more foods that are the best sources of vitamin c.
Eggs are packed with a B vitamin called biotin, which helps hair grow and strengthens brittle fingernails. Out of a group of women with hair loss, 36 percent of them were identified to have a biotin deficiency in an International Journal of Trichology study. Not having enough of this vitamin can lead to hair loss. Other good sources of biotin: almonds, avocados, and salmon.
Full of protein, iron, zinc, and biotin, lentils also have plenty of folic acid. The body needs folic acid to restore the health of red blood cells that supply skin and scalp with hair-healthy oxygen, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.
Zinc is an important mineral for overall health. When you don't have enough, you can experience hair loss — even in your eyelashes! Dr. Debé notes that zinc supplementation has been shown to improve hair loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), according to a Biological Trace Element Research study. How? Zinc helps the cells responsible for building hair do their thing. You can also find rich stores of zinc in beef, crab, and lobster.
As mentioned, iron deficiency can lead to hair loss, most notably in women. Iron is plentiful in plant-based sources such as our ol' friend spinach (and other dark leafy greens), soybeans, lentils, fortified grains, and pasta. However, the body absorbs up to three times more iron from animal sources, so your best bet might be opting for lean, ground beef a couple times a week. A 4-ounce serving of cooked, 93 percent-lean beef crumbles serves upwards of 20 percent of your daily value of iron, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database.
Notice how your muscles don't grow (and even shrink) when you're not getting enough protein? The same thing might happen to your hair. Without sufficient dietary protein, hair essentially goes on strike. Less new hair will replace what's falling out (about 50-100 hairs a day), and you'll experience a net hair loss. To get protein from meat, pick lean options like chicken, fish, or lean pork loin. They have less saturated fat than the stuff you'll find sealed in styrofoam dishes at the supermarket.
Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that can actually absorb damaging UV light and protect skin cells. It also repairs sun damage on the scalp, which can cause hair to thin. In one study, ""Tocotrienols, or different types of vitamin E supplements, were studied for eight months in patients with hair loss,"" says Dr. Debé. Thirty-eight people received the supplement, and some received a placebo. The supplemented group had a 34 percent improvement in hair growth."" Dr. Debé notes that although the amount of tocotrienols used in this study is difficult to get from diet alone, barley is a very good source.
""There are a few research-proven options to consider for male pattern baldness,"" says Dr. Debé. ""These include tocotrienols, saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol. A good food source for beta-sitosterol is pistachios."" Walnuts and other nuts contain oils that add to the amount of elastin in your hair. Elastin keeps hair supple and stops it from breaking.Dermatologists treating hair loss look at the level of ferritin in your blood, because they can deduce what your body is doing with all the iron they told you to add to your diet during your initial consultation. If you'd been eating plenty of bok choy—which is a super iron-rich food—they would likely see a spike in your ferritin levels.Two trace minerals are also connected to hair growth: selenium and iodine. Both minerals are necessary for proper functioning of the thyroid gland and deficiencies in each can lead to hair loss. To keep a steady dietary source of both minerals, consider having yogurt for breakfast or as a post-workout snack. The dairy product is teeming with the minerals. In fact, one cup of plain low-fat Greek yogurt contains half your daily iodine and 34 percent of your DV selenium. For luscious locks, don't miss our picks for the best yogurts for Weight Loss.
Besides iron, another important mineral for keeping the shine off your dome is magnesium. When your body has a magnesium deficiency, it can lead to a higher concentration of calcium, which may lead to higher insulin levels. Higher insulin levels may cause hair loss, according to the Indian Dermatology Online Journal. Halibut has plenty of magnesium, as do several other types of fish.Your hair is hungry—for the right foods!

From eggs to bell peppers, these picks are rich in essential vitamins and minerals to support hair growth.Lovely locks aren’t just the result of a stellar styling routine. Mounting scientific evidence is showing that you can eat your way to stronger, thicker, and shinier hair.“Hair follicle cells are some of the most metabolically active and have amongst the highest cell turnover rate in the body,” says Alan J Bauman, M.D., a hair restoration physician and hair transplant surgeon at Bauman Medical Group in Boca Raton, FL. “Restricting calories or falling short on protein, minerals, essential fatty acids and vitamins can lead to abnormalities in hair fiber structure and production, pigmentation changes as well as hair loss. If you’re deficient in the basic nutritional building blocks like protein, your body won’t produce healthy hair.”Hair growth is most prolific from age 15 to 30, and may slow or change after 40. While there’s no vitamin H to reboot your hair, building a menu that’s rich in these nutrients will offer the biggest benefits:If altering your diet doesn’t do the trick, speak to your doctor, suggests Salvatore J. Di Grandi, M.D., a dermatologist at CareMount Medical in Pawling, NY. Hair loss or drastic hair health changes could be a symptom of an internal disease, like an under-active thyroid, a liver issue, or an autoimmune condition like lupus. It could also be linked to “telogen effluvium,” the name for hair loss caused by a major life stressor, such as giving birth, a death in the family, a new job, or moving. These triggers will likely require a more multifaceted treatment approach.But if you’ve ruled out more serious conditions and simply want to boost volume and amp up shine, what you put on your plate matters. Here, dermatologists share the best foods for hair growth you should be eating regularly.Fueling up with enough calories and healthy fats does more than keep your muscles and heart healthy. Research in a January 2015 study from the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology showed that omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids could help reduce hair loss and improve hair growth.“Nuts, such as almonds or walnuts, and coconut oil are natural emollients for the skin and hair follicle and also moisturize the hair shaft, leaving it glossy,” says Anna D Guanche, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist at Bella Skin Institute in Calabasas, CA.Nuts and seeds are also rich in B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin E, adds Rhonda Q. Klein, M.D., a dermatologist at Modern Dermatology in Westport, CT. Vitamin E teams up with selenium to keep cell membranes strong and provide antioxidant defense.It’s probably clear as the Caribbean Sea by now that protein is important. “Sudden weight loss, or poor diets low in protein, low in healthy fats and low in phytonutrients found in fresh vegetable and fruits can contribute to shedding and limp, unhealthy hair. Women need to get about 50 grams of protein a day,” Mary Wendel, M.D., the medical director at Medi Tresse in Boston, Massachusetts.Fatty fish, like salmon, herring, tuna and sardines offer protein, vitamin D, omega-3 fats and other hair-boosting components (like linoleum acid, an essential fatty acid) to “nourish the skin and thicken the fat layer around the hair follicle, resulting in healthier hair growth,” she adds.The World Health Organization ranks iron deficiency as the world’s most common deficiency, ""affecting up to 80% of the population,” Dr. Bauman says. “Even small changes in iron levels without the presence of anemia can trigger hair loss and thinning.”While red meat, leafy greens, whole grains, beans, and egg yolks provide iron as well, Dr. Wendel and Dr. Klein are particularly fond of oysters since they offer a one-two punch of iron and zinc—the latter of which is “an essential mineral that aids in hair growth and repairs hair cycle support,” according to Dr. Klein. A 3.5-ounce serving of smoked oysters will add about 7 milligrams (mg) of iron and a whopping 63 mg of zinc to your diet.Popeye’s favorite leafy green is also in the iron-rich camp. Spinach is one of Dr. Wendel’s top vegan-friendly iron sources, a nutrient that can help prevent thinning hair.Beyond beefing up your iron levels, spinach is full of folate, along with vitamins A and C. “While vitamin C deficiency is rare in our current society, it’s essential for collagen synthesis and cross-linking of keratin fibers, which occurs in hair fiber production,” says Dr. Bauman.Get cracking! “Eggs are a great source of protein and biotin, which are both important for healthy hair and growth,” Dr. Klein says. Biotin keeps enzymes buzzing to metabolize nutrients, like fats and carbs, that nourish hair follicles. Plus, eggs yolks in particular are potent in vitamin D, which is important to get via diet or supplementation since our bodies don’t produce it naturally, says Anthony Youn, M.D., a board-certified plastic surgeon in Troy, MI. Just one large egg has about 41 IU of vitamin D, or 10% of your daily value.Dr. Wendel also recommends beans as another vegan-friendly source of iron and protein. Just 1/2 cup of white beans gets you nearly 9 grams of plant protein and 3.5 grams of iron, not to mention about 6 grams of gut-filling fiber, some zinc, selenium, and folate, too. Not feeling white beans? Black beans, chickpeas, lentils, peas, and other pulses will help you switch things up and still pack tons of hair-healthy protein, iron, and fiber.If you’re a meat-eater, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more lock-loving menu addition than lean red meat. “Grass-fed beef is rich in iron and omega-3 fatty acids, both of which can help thicken hair and make it healthier and more luxurious,” says Dr. Youn.A 4-ounce portion will score you 23 grams of protein, nearly 3 mg of iron, and roughly 6 grams of unsaturated fats.Whether you whip up healthier fries, turn them into a dessert, or toss them in a salad, sweet potatoes served any style are hair-healthy, thanks to their abundance of vitamins A and B6. In fact, the average sweet potato packs nearly six times your daily value of vitamin A, “which aids in sebum (a.k.a. oil) production and also may help speed up the rate of hair growth,” Dr. Klein says. Plus, all that vitamin A benefits your eye health and immune function, too.Not only is vitamin C crucial for healthy hair because it aids in collagen fiber synthesis, but it also plays a crucial role in the amount of iron your body actually absorbs, research shows. Of course, you can find plenty of vitamin C in fruits like oranges, strawberries, and kiwi, but red bell peppers will easily knock your daily value out of the park with 95 mg per 1/2 cup. Plus, they also pack vitamin A and some iron, zinc, selenium, and folate, too.Go for the unsweetened stuff, and you’ll pack 24 grams of protein (remember, the building blocks of your hair!) without all the added sugar that many yogurts pack. Not to mention, you’ll get a nice dose of calcium at 282 mg, which plays a role in keeping hair healthy, but many women start to lack past age 49, research shows. Eat on its own with vitamin C-rich berries, throw into protein smoothies, or make a healthier dip and skip the sour cream.Additional reporting by Alisa Hrustic",6.68,9.47,4.87,8.78,3.6,1229
31,https://www.healthshots.com/beauty/hair-care/5-vitamins-to-eat-daily-to-reduce-hair-fall-and-hair-loss/,"If you have used all the available hair products that make tall claims about being effective in the case of hair loss without actually showing any results, we have some news for you: If you are not eating right, then even the best hair care remedy is not going to work because the problem lies with your nutrition quotient.Hair loss can be due to many reasons such as scalp problems, humidity, excessive sweating, amongst other factors. But, if there is no major medical condition then it can be curbed only by giving your body certain nutrients it has been missing out on. Vitamins top the chart of effective ways of achieving a longer and stronger mane. If your diet is not right, then you can have a hair loss problem called telogen effluvium. This problem is very common and hair fall is one of the prime symptoms of it. The good news is that it can be rectified by including a few vitamins in your diet. Want to know which ones you need the most?Here are those five vitamins that you need to swear by to avoid hair fall:1. Vitamin A
If your hair is frizzy, lackluster, and breaks with just one stroke of the hairbrush, then you must include vitamin A in your diet. Basically, vitamin A is known to produce sebum on your scalp which locks moisture and nourishes your hair to boost growth.Best sources of vitamin A: Spinach, carrot, tomato, sweet potato, milk, eggs, mango, papaya, and watermelon.2. Biotin
Hair thinning points to weak hair and weak hair mean you’re likely to end up with more hair fall resulting in further thinning. Biotin or B vitamin is one of the best vitamins when it comes to your tresses.When you lack biotin, your body is unable to create enough red blood cells because of which less oxygen travels through your scalp. Due to this, your scalp is not properly nourished and you experience hair fall. According to a study published in the journal of Dermatology and Therapy, biotin deficiency can also lead to alopecia, a common hair loss problem.Best sources of biotin: Egg yolk, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, milk, cheese, and yogurt.Also, watch:3. Vitamin C
Vitamin C not just boosts your overall immune system but it also keeps a check on free radicals that hamper the growth of your hair. If you eat a diet that is rich in vitamin C then the antioxidants in it will keep scalp problems at bay while also eradicating free radicals and reducing hair loss.Have you heard of collagen? Well, it is an important part of your hair structure but it can’t be created by your body if you lack vitamin C. Hence, you need to ensure you’re consuming enough vitamin C.Best sources of vitamin C: Citrus fruits like orange, sweet lime, amla, strawberries.4. Vitamin D
The deficiency of vitamin D can also lead to alopecia. In women, it is commonly known as female pattern hair loss. According to a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, vitamin D receptors help in the formation of new hair follicles which lead to the growth of new hair strands. Due to this, the bald patch resumes hair growth.Best sources of vitamin D: Egg yolk, fish (salmon), mushrooms, oats, soy milk, and tofu.5. Vitamin E
Vitamin E works almost on similar lines as vitamin C. This one is also rich in antioxidants and helps in reducing oxidative stress and hair fall.Best sources of vitamin E: Spinach, broccoli, almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts, wheat germ oil, mango, and kiwi.So, ladies, pledge to include these vitamins in your daily diet because when you can fix your hair problems with food, why try anything else?Six-pack abs are all that Nikita needs, along with her daily dose of green tea.

    Just like skin, the condition of your hair is an outward sign of inside health. The cells that make up each strand of hair require a regular supply of key nutrients.
Eat the correct balance of the following nutrients including protein, vitamins and minerals to supply hair with all that it needs to remain shiny, lustrous and strong…As hair is made of protein, ensuring you have enough protein in your diet is crucial for making hair strong and healthy. If you are not consuming enough protein in your diet, your hair is likely to become dry, brittle and weak. Extremely low protein diets may result in restricted hair growth and even hair loss. Choose chicken, turkey, fish, dairy products and eggs as excellent sources of protein along with vegetarian sources such as legumes and nuts.Iron is an especially important mineral for hair and too little iron is a major cause of hair loss. The hair follicle and root are fed by a nutrient rich blood supply. When iron levels (serum ferritin) fall below a certain point, you may experience anaemia. This disrupts the nutrient supply to the follicle, affecting the hair growth cycle and may result in shedding. Animal products such as red meat, chicken and fish provide iron with a high bioavailability, meaning the iron is readily available to the body. Vegetarians can raise their iron stores by including lentils, spinach and other leafy green vegetables such as broccoli, kale and salad greens.More about iron-rich dietsIron-rich vegetarian recipesVitamin C aids the absorption of iron so foods high in vitamin C are good to eat in conjunction with iron-rich foods. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant so is used readily by the body. The best sources are blackcurrants, blueberries, broccoli, guava, kiwi fruits, oranges, papaya, strawberries and sweet potatoes. Vitamin C helps in the production of collagen which strengthens the capillaries that supply the hair shafts.Omega-3 fatty acids are important fats our body cannot make itself, and therefore must be obtained through our diet. Omega-3s are found in the cells that line the scalp and also provide the oils that keep your scalp and hair hydrated. Include oily fish such as salmon, herring, sardines, trout and mackerel and plant sources like avocado, pumpkin seeds and walnuts.Vitamin A is needed by the body to make sebum. Sebum is an oily substance created by our hairs sebaceous glands and provides a natural conditioner for a healthy scalp. Without sebum we may experience an itchy scalp and dry hair. Include animal products and orange/yellow coloured vegetables which are high in beta-carotene (which makes vitamin A) such as carrots, pumpkins and sweet potatoes.Scalp protection involves other important minerals, notably zinc and selenium. A lack of zinc can lead to hair loss and a dry, flaky scalp. Fortified cereals and wholegrains are a good source of zinc along with oysters, beef and eggs.The sun can damage our hair just like it can damage our skin so ensure you eat foods rich in vitamin E to provide protection for your hair. Nuts are nutritional powerhouses, providing zinc and selenium as well as vitamin E so try to include them as part of a balanced diet.Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin. Too little biotin can cause brittle hair and may lead to hair loss. Include biotin rich foods such as wholegrains, liver, egg yolk, soy flour and yeast.Make your own hair mask for a deep, nourishing treatment every two weeks. Whisk an egg yolk and mix with half a mashed avocado and a spoonful of honey. Massage onto damp, clean hair and leave for 30 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.An overall balanced diet is necessary for a healthy scalp and healthy hair. Try out some of the following tasty recipes to support your locks.Legumes like kidney beans and lentils are sources of protein, iron, biotin and zinc:Jerk chicken curry with beansPepper lime salmon with black-eyed beansBasic lentilsSpinach, sweet potato & lentil dhalNuts are rich in zinc and selenium:Spiced cauliflower with chickpeas, herbs & pine nutsBaked aubergine stuffed with roast pumpkin, feta & walnuts with minted courgettesFig & walnut sliceTropical treatBeef is a brilliant source of protein and iron:Chilli beef shepherd’s pieThai beef stir-fryDon’t forget orange vegetables and dark leafy greens!Pumpkin & parsnip cassouletStir-fried curly kale with chilli & garlicOrange, carrot & mint soupSweet potato & chicken curryBoost your omega-3 with these fishy favourites:Spicy salmon & lentilsGriddled tuna with bean & tomato saladWarm mackerel & beetroot saladSmoked mackerel, orange & couscous saladSardines with chickpeas, lemon & parsleyEach hair is attached to the scalp via a follicle. There are between 100,000 and 350,000 hair follicles on the human scalp. Each follicle grows its hair for an average of 1000 days (three years) and then rests for a period of around 100 days (three months) before being shed and a new hair begins to grow. This pattern of active growth followed by the resting period varies significantly from person to person and is influenced by age, diet and our state of health.Hair is primarily made of a protein called keratin that also makes nails and forms the outer protective layer of skin. Each hair consists of three layers:1. The cuticle – the outer layer, thin and colourless. It acts as the protective layer.2. The cortex which contains melanin, which is responsible for hair colour.3. The medulla, the innermost layer which reflects light.Did you know……Whether your hair is straight or curly depends on the shape of the cortex. On average, blondes have more hair and redheads have the least.The length of hair that you are able to grow is controlled by the duration of the growing phase, which varies between individuals. We all lose some hair naturally each day when we brush, comb or wash it and as long as new hairs are being produced at the same rate as those falling out, there will be no difference in hair volume. However if the rate of shedding exceeds production the net result is hair loss or thinning.A variety of factors can alter the normal hair growth cycle and cause temporary or permanent hair loss including medication, chemotherapy, exposure to chemicals and toxins such as nicotine, hormonal factors, thyroid disease, stress or nutritional factors.We shed hair every day as part of our body’s natural process. Hair loss can happen at any time of life for any number of reasons. When hair loss becomes a concern, it is important to determine the cause before seeking out the appropriate treatment.Potential non-dietary factors for hair loss include:This condition can result in total loss of hair from the head and sometimes loss of body hair also, although most sufferers develop a few isolated patches of hair loss, which may correct themselves without any treatment. Since the cause is unknown, treatment is hard. Talk to your GP if you are concerned about hair loss.This article was last reviewed on 4 July 2019 by Kerry Torrens.Kerry Torrens is a qualified Nutritionist (MBANT) with a post graduate diploma in Personalised Nutrition & Nutritional Therapy.

33,https://hudabeauty.com/us/en_US/blog/21-skincare-tips-thatll-transform-your-skin-52826.html,"FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS $60+BOOK YOUR VIRTUAL BEAUTY CONSULTATIONThe skincare industry can be kinda overwhelming, which is why we’re (always) here to help. And we totally understand your dilemma; with literally hundreds of innovative products being released each week and the discovery of another “must-have” ingredient, it can be hard to determine what products you really need and what’s just a trend. To guide you through the beauty-jargon on your quest for happy, healthy skin, here are 21 skincare tips that cover ALL the bases.Understanding and getting to know your skin type is the most important thing you can do for your skin. If you’re unaware or misinformed, you could compromise your skin’s natural balance and trigger irritation, inflammation, breakouts, and even premature aging by using the wrong products. The most common skin types are oily, acne-prone, dry, sensitive, and mature skin; it’s also important to note that you can be more than one type and it can change over time or through the seasons, so always listen to your skin. For more deets on decoding your skin type, read this.If you don’t apply your skincare products in the right order you could prevent them from being fully-absorbed, which means they won’t be as effective. The general rule is to apply the most lightweight formulas first so they can be easily absorbed without the barrier of heavier creams. To avoid piling (those tiny little balls you get when you’ve used too much product), when you move onto thicker creams, give your skin time to absorb the product (at least a few minutes).When it comes to skincare, ‘more is more’ is not a good rule. So if you apply too much moisturizer, the product will likely pill or could potentially block your pores. Plus, it’s a total waste of product and your money considering your skin won’t be able to absorb it all anyway! Make sure you follow this sizing guide:Double cleansing is our fave K-beauty hack, and it’s completely transformed our skin. By cleansing twice, you’ll ensure all the dirt, bacteria, oil and pollution that’s built up on your skin during the day has been removed, leaving you with a thoroughly clean base for you to layer your nighttime skincare routine onto. Check out our full guide to double cleansing here.Before you start using a new product, you should always do a patch test to avoid the risk of irritation or an allergic reaction. Just apply a small amount of product to your inner arm to see how your skin reacts to the formula.Hanging onto products past their expiry dates is a big no-no: It’s bad for you. Sadly, your beloved beauty products harbor bacteria (especially if you use them frequently), and these can lead to infections and irritations, not to mention, they don’t perform as well – we’re talking to you, gunky mascara! After a while, products can produce harmful toxins that can be dangerous to your health as well as your skin. As a general rule, if you can’t remember when you bought your face cream, SPF, foundation, mascara or eyeliner – get rid of it!If you didn’t know, this little jar with a floating lid signals how long you can use your product for once you’ve opened it. So, if it reads 12M that means you’ve got a whole year to enjoy your product – usually lipsticks, blushes, eyeshadows, and foundation will be anywhere in this expiration region, or perhaps even up to 24M. Skincare products with active ingredients could be anywhere from 3M to 6M – so now you know, it’s really worth checking. Especially with skincare containing active ingredients or SPF, as they lose their efficacy and might not give you the protection you need.Don’t assume that a good skincare routine has to cost you serious dough! There’re so many amazing drugstore products and affordable brands with awesome formulas: From our fave drugstore $13 retinol to our $4 daily cleanser; to the $12 cream Meghan Markle swears by, you just need to know what to look for. Check out these derm-approved skincare products.If you’re using a new product and your skin starts acting out, your skin may be purging. According to celeb dermatologist and author of Beyond Beautiful, Dr. Doris Day “A purge is a reaction from a product. It can be an irritant reaction to a product, leading to piling up of skin cells and their underlying contents. It can be due to an imbalance of water in the skin, an imbalance of the way the cells exfoliate or an imbalance of elements within the skin.” What this means is, the product might not be breaking you out, but it’s causing a reaction in your skin – this doesn’t always mean you should disregard the product. Read our guide to knowing if you’re purging here.If there’s one thing literally ALL derms tell us; it’s the importance of using sunscreen daily to help protect your skin from sun damage. 90% of how your skin ages is within your control and is directly linked to sun exposure. So even on cloudy, winter days, protect your skin by using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or above and a 5-star UVA rating. Just apply sunscreen every day, and your skin will thank you for it.Most of us will associate a face mask with the occasional pamper night with your girls. But masks are actually super important and can be incorporated into your daily routine. Celebrity facialist Georgia Louise recommends doing a 10-minute mask every morning to hydrate and soothe the skin. Face masks can help address a whole array of skin concerns from oily and acne-prone skin to dry or sensitive skin; you just need to find the right mask for your skin type. Check out our fave masks here. Even if you don’t have time every day, do a clay mask once a week and a sheet mask to hydrate as often as possible.Sleeping masks are SO much more than a skincare trend. When you sleep, your skin repairs and replenishes as your skin’s metabolism improves, enabling your skin cells to reproduce more efficiently. By wearing a hydrating overnight mask, you’ll enhance this regeneration process, as it’ll act as a protective barrier against dirt or bacteria so that when you wake up your skin is at its best!

This Is One Of The Best Things You Can Do For Your Skin


The weather is another external factor that can wreak havoc on your skin. Just think about it: during the winter, the combination of low temperatures outside and increased indoor heating can seriously dry out your skin. Whereas in the summer, you’re dealing with humidity, sun exposure, and climbing temperatures; causing oily skin, dark spots, and even sun damage. That’s why it’s essential to combat the opposing temperatures with different formulas and ingredients throughout the year. Read our summer skin guide and winter skin guide to find out more.Everyone’s skin is constantly changing and adapting to its surrounding environment. This is why it’s so important to switch up your skincare, not only for the seasons, but also according to your age. As you age, the levels of collagen in your skin begin to decline (bummer, we know), and your skin tends to dry out. You can also develop skin conditions in your 20s like rosacea or adult acne. This is why it’s super important to take the time to examine the changes in your skin as you get older, so you can cater to your skin’s developing needs. Read our skincare guidelines for your age here.No matter how many miracle products you slather on your face, if your diet sucks, your skin just won’t be bringing its A-game. To get that glow, you need to be supplying your body with beauty-boosting vitamins and minerals, and the right nutrients to strengthen your gut. Similarly, there are some foods that you need to avoid if you’re munching with your skin in mind.You also need to make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day – it’s a skincare no brainer. If you ask any model what their top skincare secret is, it’s to always stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. If you’re not drinking enough water, it can make your skin look dull and emphasize fine lines (you should aim for at least 2 liters a day).Our hormones don’t just impact our mood and our energy levels, they majorly impact our skin too. By understanding your monthly cycle, you can tweak and tailor your routine to ensure your skin’s living its best life, all year round. For instance, from days 1-7 as your female hormones are low, it’s important to load up on vitamin c and zinc to up your immune system and hydrate your skin. For more deets on how your cycle impacts your skin, check out this post.Exfoliation is an essential step in any good skincare regimen. We love chemical exfoliators, like AHAs, BHAs, or an enzyme-based formula, as they’re able to effectively cleanse your pores and dissolve dead skin cells while promoting skin regeneration, leaving your skin clean and radiant. With that said, make sure you only use a chemical exfoliator two to three times a week to avoid over-exfoliation.A lot of people are intimated by retinol, and while we understand why, it can make such a difference to your skin. Retinol can help to fade scars, improve the appearance of fine lines, and even out your skin tone. You just need to know how and when to add it to your routine. Read our full retinol guide here.Vitamin C is one of the strongest antioxidants on the shelves, which means it helps to protect your skin from environmental stressors that can accelerate aging. Vitamin C also works overtime to brighten your skin and works in tandem with your SPF to improve its sun protecting powers. Check out our fave budget vitamin C serums here.Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate – we’re not kidding! When it comes to your skin, hydration is everything. Even if you have oily skin, you need to keep your skin hydrated; otherwise, it’ll produce more oil in an attempt to compensate. Make sure you’re moisturizing twice a day and topping up with a nighttime serum and facial mist throughout the day. Look for hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, peptides, and ceramides.

Lazy Girl's Guide: The Best Lazy Girl Products For Glowing Skin


Neglecting the neck area is one of the most common skincare mistakes, which is kinda crazy as it’s one the of biggest giveaways of someone’s age. So always make sure you continue your entire skincare routine down your neck; this means double cleansing your neck as well as toning and moisturizing. Also, be gentle and massage in upward motions so that you’re not pulling the skin downward, which is precisely where you don’t want your skin to go! If neck lines are a concern of yours, check out our guide to getting rid of neck lines.As tempting as it may be to pop a pimple, try to resist the urge as you’ll most likely spread the bacteria and you could even leave a scar. Also, while it may feel like you’ve sanitized the area and cleaned the pimple, there’s so much stuff happening within your skin that you can’t see, and it’s this bacteria that you’ll spread. With that said, we understand that regardless of what we say, you’re probably going to try to at some point anyway, so read our guide on how to pop a pimple in the safest way.Let us know what skin concern you’d like us to write about next in the comments below.

34,https://www.wellandgood.com/skinceuticals-discoloration-defense/,"Zoe Weiner・August 29, 2020The serum is one of a few products on the market that contains tranexamic acid, which is an incredibly helpful topical ingredient to even out skin tone, and a great alternative to hydroquinone, an ingredient that is commonly used for skin brightening, but may be too harsh for certain skin types. “This product contains a great combination of tranexamic acid and kojic acid,” says board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD of the combo that helps to nix hyperpigmentation. “It also contains niacinamide, which is helpful for tone and texture.” It’s great for treating every sort of discoloration from dark spots to melasma to acne scarring, and works to effectively create an even canvas across your entire complexion.Board-certified dermatologist Caren Cambpbell, MD, is also a fan of the serum. According to her, niacinamide is also an antioxidant, which means it can help fight off some of the free-radical damage that eventually leads to skin aging conditions such as hyperpigmentation. In a 12-week study, the serum was found to improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation by 60 percent and improve acne scarring by 81 percent.Skinceuticals Discoloration Defense is a great addition to any morning and evening routine, and Dr. Campbell advocates for using it after any sort of pro-grade microneedling or laser treatment to allow it to penetrate the skin more deeply. “Delivering these powerful lightening agents can help fade melasma and sunspots more quickly than laser and microneedling alone,” she says. You can pair it with vitamin C in the a.m., and be sure to follow it up with some solid SPF 30 (which is an important factor for avoiding brown spots in the first place) while also avoiding sun exposure.Want even more beauty intel from our editors?

35,https://www.healthshots.com/beauty/skin-care/oily-skin-care-avoid-these-4-foods-to-prevent-acne/,"What’s on your plate can also be on your skin. Yes, we aren’t kidding as food can be another villain for your beautiful skin. Because guess what? The food you eat can give you major acne.Basically what we eat has an impact on our overall health, then may it be our heart or skin. If we eat healthy our skin will also glow, as healthy food means fewer toxins in our body.  According to Dr Radha Gongati, senior consultant, dermatologist, venereology, and leprosy at Apollo Telehealth, if you already have oily skin then eating foods that have a high glycemic index (GI), i.e. high in carbs and fat thus affecting our blood glucose levels, can make your skin worse. Also, certain foods amp up the production of sebum in the skin which produces more oil than your skin required for nourishment.  Do you know a study that says that if you eat a nutritious diet then you can also treat the worst kind of zits called acne vulgaris? That’s why today we are asking you to boycott these four foods to save your skin from excess oiliness and it’s after-effects:1. Milk or dairy products
‘Dairy milk products is something that you must avoid if you want to prevent oily skin-related problems. But if you love your cuppa of milk then you can still opt for low-calorie milk options like soya or almond. But still, I would say you should restrain from sweets as they won’t spare your skin,” she explains.2. Chocolates
Chocolate is laden with sugar and this sugar leads to inflammation which directly impacts your skin by making it oily. “You can opt for dark chocolate instead, but in moderation like once in 15 days”, she suggests.3. Junk and fried food
“We all love eating burgers and pizzas but we tend to forget that they ingredients like cheese, mayo, butter, and whatnot. This can increase the quantity of oil in our body and our skin won’t be able to support this extra dose. The result? Oily skin and acne”, Dr Gongati explains.4. Red meat
Even if you love eating meat, please then don’t make it a daily occurrence in your diet as it is rich in animal fat. And now you know just how bad fat is for your skin.“Apart from these, there is no concrete evidence about other food items that can make your skin oily. It also depends on person to person and skin type to skin type. The key when it comes to food is moderation. Just keep that in mind and you are good to go”, concludes Dr Gongati.Six-pack abs are all that Nikita needs, along with her daily dose of green tea. At Health Shots, she produces videos, podcasts, stories, and other kick-ass content. With a single click, you can sign up and save anything and everything you’d like to read later.

36,https://www.self.com/story/guide-to-skin-care,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.By Sarah JacobyDepending on who you ask, having a skin-care routine could mean a million different things. Is it putting on the occasional acne-fighting sheet mask? Lining up all 18 of your expensive serums for the perfect #shelfie? Reading and somehow understanding the textbook of an ingredients list on every product? Or is it carefully applying juuust the right amount of prescription cream to calm down a patch of psoriasis without feeling too greasy?The truth is, of course, that it can be all of the above—and each skin-care routine is necessarily as unique and individual as the person following it (or attempting to, anyway). But as skin care has become trendier and its definition has become wider in scope, it’s also gotten a little more intimidating and confusing for a beginner to get started.That’s where we come in. As you begin your skin-care quest, we hope to answer here in this skin-care 101 guide as many of your questions as we can—with the help of research and experts rather than hype.Here’s how to use this guide: If you’re brand-new to the idea of a skin-care routine, it helps to start at the very beginning, where we answer your most basic questions about skin care—even the ones you may be too embarrassed to ask all your skin-care-savvy friends. If you’ve dabbled in skin care and just really want to know what ingredients might be right for you, we’ve got you. Scroll down to learn more about the actual elements in a skin-care routine and an overview of active ingredients that work best for certain skin conditions. We also have specific sections for skin of color, what to do if you’re pregnant, and what to keep in mind if you have a diagnosed condition that affects your skin. Plus we break down some often confusing aspects about the skin-care industry, such as whether or not the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates skin-care ingredients and what exactly manufacturers mean when they call their products “clean.”In each section, you’ll find links to all our coverage on that topic, so make sure you click on anything that piques your interest if you want to learn even more.And last, don’t forget to check out our glossary of popular skin-care terms, which can help clear up any lingering confusion you have.Let’s get started!We mean the basic care and keeping of your largest organ—your skin! It plays an important role in protecting you from outside pathogens and, you know, holds all your internal organs in place. And in the same way that you regularly brush your teeth, your skin requires at least some attention to keep it functioning properly.It also requires protection—from skin cancer, primarily. At SELF, when we talk about skin care we’re talking about science-backed ways to improve both the look and function of your skin to address and manage both cosmetic and medical concerns.This guide is for anyone who is curious about what it means or what it takes to have a skin-care routine but doesn’t know where to start.Yes, caring about skin care might be quite trendy these days, but no matter what, giving your skin some love has both cosmetic and medical benefits. For instance, although you can’t slow down the passage of time, with a finely tuned skin-care regimen you can reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, and sun damage. You can also quite effectively manage some more minor skin concerns, such as dryness or oiliness.For those with specific skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, rosacea, and acne, skin care isn’t always optional and requires a bit more thought. For one, treating a specific skin condition often means you need to employ a particular skin-care regimen, and for another, your condition may make your skin more sensitive to ingredients and products in general. Finding a skin-care routine that works can offer a vital way for someone to manage and treat their condition.There’s also the fact that many people find their skin-care routines to have some mental health benefits—having that routine may help you realize just how easy it can be to do nice things for your body and build healthy habits. Two great examples of this are “Why I Embraced Skin Care After My Mother’s Death” and “How Skin Care Became a Crucial Part of My Sobriety Toolbox”, personal essays we’ve published in recent years.We also know that practicing skin care can provide benefits not entirely related to your skin. Many people find that sticking to a skin-care regimen gives them a routine and sense of control. Others find that going through their routine or even applying the occasional mask relaxes them and helps them focus their attention on themselves maybe for the only time in their day.That said, some skin-care companies make a lot of big claims about what their products can do without necessarily having the evidence to back them up. At SELF, our aim is to help you make the most informed decision before buying or trying a product and to guide you toward the treatment options we know the most about.Before figuring out what to include in your skin-care routine, it’s important to know your skin type and if you have any major concerns you want to address. It’s also good to remember that everyone’s regimen is individual—what works for your friends or family or randos online may not be best for you.To figure out your skin type, think about how your skin acts without any makeup or products on it a few hours after taking a shower. If it gets a little greasy or shiny, you probably have oily skin. If it feels dry or flaky, you have dry skin. If you have dry skin in some places and oily skin in others (usually on the T-zone), you have combination skin. If you have none of those things, you’re considered to have “normal” skin. Knowing your skin type will help steer you toward products that will manage dryness and oiliness while effectively taking care of any other skin concerns you have.If your skin tends to get irritated when you use certain products, if you’ve ever had an allergic reaction to a product, or if you have certain skin conditions on your face (eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, et cetera) you may have sensitive skin. People with sensitive skin can have oily, dry, combination, or normal skin too, but may need to take extra care in selecting products that don’t cause irritation or exacerbate skin conditions.You don’t necessarily need to see a dermatologist before starting a skin-care routine. But if you have sensitive skin (or aren’t sure if your skin qualifies as sensitive), if you have a skin condition, or if you’re trying to address any major concerns (such as stubborn or severe acne or hyperpigmentation), it’s important to check in with a board-certified dermatologist who can guide you through the process.Here are some great articles that can help you before you begin a skin-care routine:Skin care doesn’t have to be complicated if you don’t want it to be. The three basic steps of a skin-care routine are cleansing, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen (at least SPF 30 and broad spectrum). You should cleanse then moisturize every morning and night. You should also apply sunscreen every morning, but you can use a moisturizer that has at least 30 SPF and broad-spectrum protection to combine those two steps. You can use a daytime moisturizer with SPF at night too, although you may find that a thicker product is more moisturizing and better suited to nighttime use because you don’t need to worry about being able to put makeup over it—plus, you don’t need to worry about SPF while you’re sleeping.If you wear heavy makeup or sunscreen during the day, you may find that your cleanser doesn’t get all your makeup off or still leaves you feeling kind of greasy. In that case, you might benefit from double cleansing, a process in which you wash first with an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser or micellar water on a cotton pad to remove anything left behind. But double cleansing is not a requirement.Serums, toners, exfoliants, and prescription treatments should be applied after cleansing but before moisturizing.Read more about the basic steps of a skin-care routine:This is where products that contain specific active ingredients—known as just “actives” by skin-care enthusiasts—come in. Active ingredients are chemicals or compounds in a product that are actually treating your skin for the concern the product is supposed to treat it for. For example, if you buy a product to help treat your acne, the active ingredient is the ingredient doing most of the work to clear up your acne.Some actives may be broken out on a product label in a drug-facts box because they’re regulated more tightly by the (FDA). But in general the FDA doesn’t test cosmetic skin-care products for safety or efficacy, so we don’t really know how well they work most of the time. That’s why there’s always some trial and error inherent in figuring out a skin-care routine for your specific skin.The use of most actives is based on some research though, so we have at least a theory about what they can do and how well they do it.Read more about active ingredients:Picking the right active ingredients depends on the specific skin concerns you’re hoping to address. Here are a few of the most common issues:Some common signs of aging include photodamage dark spots, fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin.IngredientsRetinoids: These compounds—retinol, retinal (or retinaldehyde), retinoic acid, and synthetic retinoids like Adapalene and Tazerac—are one of only two proven ways to prevent the signs of aging. (The other is sunscreen!) Retinoids, which are forms of vitamin A, work by stimulating the skin-cell-shedding process from below, leading to smoother skin and a reduction in both signs of aging and acne. These come in both prescription and over-the-counter products, so if you aren’t satisfied with the results of an over-the-counter option, check with a dermatologist about getting a prescription version. Retinoids are also notorious for causing irritation when you first start using them, so it’s crucial to apply them just a few days a week to start with and to apply a moisturizer right after using them.Sunscreen: You’ve likely used a sunscreen before to prevent sunburns, which are one form of U.V. damage. But did you know that U.V. rays can also contribute to other kinds of damage? And that damage can cause dark spots, wrinkles, and other signs of aging? It’s true. Preventing that—and skin cancer, of course—is a major reason to use sunscreen every single day. Be sure to use a sunscreen that’s at least SPF 30 and provides broad-spectrum protection, meaning it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Although the sunscreen in your makeup doesn’t count as your daily SPF, the sunscreen in your moisturizer can—as long as you use it on your ears and neck as well as your face.Niacinamide: This is a form of vitamin B3 (niacin) that can be applied to the skin. There is some research to suggest that it can be helpful for managing acne, rosacea, and signs of aging including hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles.Ceramides: Ceramides are intercellular lipids, meaning they fill in the spaces between your skin cells in the stratum corneum (the outer protective layer of skin). Your skin already makes ceramides on its own—without them, your skin won’t be able to effectively hold moisture in or keep irritants out. Topical ceramides may be present in both prescription treatments for eczema and over-the-counter products.Vitamin C: Yes, that vitamin C! This vitamin is essential for producing collagen and other important compounds in the body. And when it’s applied topically it can function as an antioxidant, thus preventing U.V.-related damage. It can also inhibit the production of melanin (pigment) in the skin, making it a good option for lightening dark spots due to photoaging or other kinds of damage. But beware that all forms of vitamin C are not created equal—some are more or less effective or stable than others. Vitamin C often appears on the label as these derivatives—look for ingredients such as magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl 6-palmitate, ascorbic acid sulfate, or L-ascorbic acid (also referred to simply as ascorbic acid).Peptides: Peptides are known as the building blocks of proteins. They’re made up of short chains of amino acids. In the realm of skin-care, we mostly talk about peptides as building up collagen, a protein your skin needs to keep its structure. Different types of peptides might do the job of bolstering your collagen in different ways, but the most common ones are signaling peptides, which can both stimulate the skin’s collagen production and slow down the natural breakdown of collagen.More on ingredients for aging:Although it’s very common, acne is a lot more complicated than most of us realize. For instance, there are different types of pimples (whiteheads, blackheads, et cetera), which may be inflamed (red, swollen, painful) or not. Acne can also be influenced by many factors in your life, such as your hormones. So if your acne is severe or if your over-the-counter treatment options aren’t helping, it’s important to see a dermatologist who may be able to prescribe you something more effective.A note on fungal acne: Fungal acne is a colloquial term for a type of yeast infection that inflames the hair follicles on your skin. The actual name for this condition is either pityrosporum folliculitis or malassezia folliculitis, depending on whom you’re talking to. It causes red bumps and pustules that might look like acne, but don’t usually affect the face. Unlike actual acne, so-called fungal acne is treated with antifungal medications. So if you’re not sure what type of bumps you’re dealing with or your usual acne treatments don’t seem to be helping, talk to a dermatologist to see if you might be dealing with a fungal issue instead.IngredientsRetinoids (see above)Chemical exfoliants: You may already be familiar with physical exfoliants such as scrubs and brushes. And while those are perfectly effective at removing dead skin that can clog pores, they’re not exactly gentle. That’s why many dermatologists recommend their patients stick with chemical exfoliants, which include both alpha hydroxy acids, or AHAs (such as lactic acid and glycolic acid), and beta hydroxy acids, or BHAs (essentially just salicylic acid). Rather than physically scrubbing the dead skin cells off your face, these break down the bonds between those cells so that you can easily wipe them away. They’re present in all kinds of products, including cleansers, toners, masks, and serums.Benzoyl peroxide: Unlike salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide can kill the type of bacteria that’s often responsible for inflamed acne. That’s why it’s often recommended to use both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid to help manage mild to moderate acne. For more severe acne, a retinoid or other prescription treatment may be necessary. Both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide can also irritate or dry out skin, so it’s important to also use a moisturizer when you’re using these ingredients.Niacinamide (see above)Azelaic acid: A type of acid synthesized by yeast, barley, and wheat that’s believed to have a gentle exfoliating effect. Research has shown that it’s effective at managing both acne and acne-like bumps that are a common symptom of rosacea. It comes in prescription and over-the-counter forms.More on how to treat acne:For some people, scars are almost a badge of honor or a physical mark that shows you endured an intense event. But others would rather not have them hanging around. And if you’re trying to minimize the appearance of a scar, the first thing to know is that you’ll have to be patient—and especially skeptical.Over-the-counter topical scar treatments don’t have a ton of evidence behind them, unfortunately. What does work? Moisturizing—almost to an excessive degree—and time. If that doesn’t help, you should chat with a dermatologist about your other options, which may include prescription topical treatments or laser treatments.When it comes to dark spots, melasma, or other hyperpigmentation concerns, though, you can try brightening ingredients, like vitamin C and hydroquinone.Ingredients:Vitamin C (see above)Chemical exfoliants (see above)Retinoids (see above)Sunscreen: Prevents dark spots from getting darker (see more above). Emerging research suggests that visible light, including light that comes from our devices like phones and laptops, may be a factor in exacerbating hyperpigmentation, especially melasma. Some experts recommend that people trying to manage those issues look for sunscreens containing iron oxides, which block visible light, in addition to other SPF ingredients. You’ll have to check the ingredients to find out if your sunscreen has them, but know that sunscreens with a tint usually have iron oxides.Hydroquinone: Considered the gold standard of brightening ingredients, hydroquinone is available over-the-counter at (concentrations of up to 2%) and via prescription in higher strengths.Read more about treating skin with scars and discoloration:Dry skin also tends to be sensitive, and dry skin can also be a symptom of skin conditions that make the skin more sensitive, like eczema. So products for dry skin are often suitable for sensitive skin as well—but not always.If you have sensitive skin (meaning you are prone to irritation or allergic reactions or have a skin condition like eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea), it’s especially important to be aware that products containing things like parabens and fragrances are more likely to cause a reaction. It’s also a good idea to patch test any new product on your inner arm before using it all over your face.Ingredients:Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid is found naturally in the skin and acts as a humectant, meaning it can draw moisture into the skin; products with these molecules allow moisture to bind to the skin without feeling greasy or heavy.Squalane oil: Squalane is a light moisturizing oil that mimics a component of sebum, the oily substance our skin produces. There is limited research on the effect of topical squalane on skin, but in general it acts like an emollient when applied, which means that it can squeeze into the spaces between skin cells and make your face feel smoother and more moisturized without being too heavy or occlusive.Colloidal Oatmeal: Colloidal oatmeal is made from grinding oats and mixing them with water or other liquid, which creates a mixture that can provide a soothing, protective barrier on the skin. Experts recommend it specifically for dry and sensitive skin, including skin that’s actively irritated, in which the skin’s natural barrier may need some extra help.Bakuchiol: Bakuchiol is a plant extract that some early research suggests can have a beneficial effect on skin, particularly with regard to managing signs of aging, without irritation. It’s often called a “natural retinol alternative,” although it doesn’t have the same amount of conclusive evidence behind it. But experts say bakuchiol may be a good option—especially if your skin is too sensitive for retinoids.Niacinamide: (see above)Ceramides: (see above)Read more on treating sensitive skin:As we mentioned above, cosmetic skin-care ingredients don’t go through FDA testing before they hit the market, so we don’t have data on how effective or safe each over-the-counter product is. Many companies make claims about their products based on the ingredients that are in the product, which may or may not be similar to the ingredients used in scientific research.Basically, unless you’re using a prescription treatment, it’s tough to know what you’re actually getting when, so it always pays to weigh the potential risks and benefits before putting something new on your skin. So your best bet is to spend money on products containing active ingredients with the most promising research behind them.In general the risks include irritation, allergic reactions, or simply wasting time and money. But if you have sensitive skin or a skin condition, you’re more likely to experience those kinds of adverse reactions, so you’ll want to be more careful when trying new products, especially trendy new ingredients that don’t have a lot of solid evidence for their claims. If in doubt, you can always check with a dermatologist.More about trendy skin-care ingredients and the actual science behind them:People of color are generally more susceptible to skin issues involving hyperpigmentation, such as melasma and post-acne dark spots. You may also be more likely to develop scarring or hyperpigmentation after inflammatory skin issues, like acne, psoriasis, or eczema.That can be frustrating because treating pigmentation concerns in darker skin is often somewhat challenging with treatments that are commonly used on white skin, like laser treatments. But laser treatment techniques have advanced a lot in recent years, and in the hands of an experienced practitioner they can be safely used in patients with skin of color. Additionally, topical treatments containing things like hydroquinone and vitamin C can help too. But whatever you do, know that treating hyperpigmentation takes time—possibly six months to a year.There’s also a prevalent myth that people with darker skin don’t need to wear sunscreen—this is definitely not true! The sun can still cause damage even if you’re not getting sunburned. And that damage can both lead to skin cancer and exacerbate hyperpigmentation. If you have any questions about how to care for your skin of color or about managing an issue like melasma, your best bet is to talk to a dermatologist.More on caring for skin of color:When you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, you may need to temporarily stop using certain products, especially certain acne products. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), pregnant people should definitely avoid using retinoids including isotretinoin, tretinoin, tazarotene, spironolactone, and adapalene. You should also be careful about certain antibiotics, such as doxycycline. Depending on your doctor’s recommendations, you may also need to avoid or limit benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Instead, dermatologists often recommend pregnant people use azelaic acid to manage acne.You should also be cautious about brightening ingredients, particularly hydroquinone. This is another ingredient you should stop using while you’re pregnant.In general, though, we don’t have a ton of information about how these (and, honestly, most) medications affect pregnant people, the AAD says. Many of these recommendations are based on an absence of conclusive evidence that they are safe rather than having evidence that they’re definitely harmful.Above all it’s important to check in with your doctor or dermatologist before using something on your skin when pregnant or breastfeeding because they can assess your individual skin situation and help you figure out what makes sense for you.More on caring for your skin while you’re pregnant:If you have a skin condition (such as rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, or severe acne) or any condition that affects your skin, it’s important for you to see a dermatologist and make your skin-care decisions with their input. Not only is your skin likely to be more sensitive to skin-care products, you also don’t want to do anything that might exacerbate the underlying condition.Plus if you’re trying to manage that condition, you can only go so far with over-the-counter products. Sometimes they can get the job done (like using a drugstore cleanser containing salicylic acid for mild acne), but you want to be sure that you’re not overlooking another option that may be more effective, like a prescription retinoid.So over-the-counter products aren’t off-limits for you entirely, but you will want to approach them with caution. It may be wise for you to do patch tests (putting a small amount of a new product on your inner arm for a day or two) before using anything new, or your dermatologist can perform a formal test in their office to see which ingredients you’re likely to be sensitive to. With the right approach, skin care can be an effective (and maybe even fun!) way to manage the symptoms of your condition.More on caring for your skin if you have a medical condition:Considering how little the FDA is involved in regulating cosmetic skin-care ingredients, it’s understandable that you’d want to do whatever you can to make sure you’re only putting the safest ingredients possible on your skin.But today words like clean and natural are more buzzwords than anything else. These terms don’t have agreed-upon definitions and aren’t regulated by the FDA, so any company can define clean beauty however it wants and give itself that label.It’s also important to remember that just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s safe. In fact, natural herbal and botanical ingredients are frequently irritants and allergens for those with sensitive skin. And our health concerns about certain chemicals in makeup and skin-care products are often overblown.Moreover, herbal and botanical ingredients (which are still chemicals, BTW) aren’t necessarily analogous to the compounds tested in clinical trials. For instance, rosehip contains vitamin A but isn’t the same thing as retinol or retinoic acid, so you don’t necessarily know how much vitamin A you’re putting on your face or what kinds of effects you can expect.Again, we recommend opting for products that contain ingredients we know the most about. And if you’re not sure if something is right for your skin, talk to a dermatologist.More on what clean and natural beauty really mean:Well, first off we’d suggest checking out the 2020 SELF Healthy Beauty Awards winners.

37,https://www.nytimes.com/guides/tmagazine/skincare-routine,"How to Build a Skin Care RoutineShareBy Kari MolvarIllustrations by Konstantin Kakanias, Animation by Jonathan EdenGreat skin is not simply a matter of DNA — your daily habits, in fact, have a big impact on what you see in the mirror. But depending on which product reviews you read or doctors you consult, there is a dizzying number of opinions on everything from how to moisturize to how to protect yourself from UV rays. Ultimately, caring for your skin is simply personal. Here’s what you should keep in mind to sort through all the noise. 
Think of your skin-care routine as consisting of three main steps:The goal of any skin-care routine is to tune up your complexion so it’s functioning at its best, and also troubleshoot or target any areas you want to work on. “Beauty routines are an opportunity to notice changes within yourself,” says the San Francisco skin-care specialist Kristina Holey. As your skin needs shifts with age, so will your products. Still, she adds, “it’s not about creating perfection.”   Allow these three steps to become your daily ritual that fortifies your skin and grounds your day. 
The science behind skin-care products has come a long way but there’s still no such thing as an instant fix — you need time to reap the benefits, says Dr. Rachel Nazarian, a Manhattan dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group. “Results are only seen through consistent use,” she explains. Generally, aim to use a product over at least six weeks, once or twice daily, to notice a difference.  
Tip: With any skin-care product, apply in order of consistency — from thinnest to thickest. For example, cleanser, toner (if you use it), serum, and then moisturizer.
August 14, 2017May 10, 2016August 11, 2016April 18, 2016Washing your face is the most basic and essential step of any routine, says the New York City dermatologist Dr. Carlos Charles. “Our skin comes in contact with environmental pollutants, dirt and other factors each day that should be gently removed.” Wash twice a day, morning and night, to avoid clogged pores, dullness and acne.The right formula cleanses your skin without stripping essential, healthy oils. Take it easy with exfoliating scrubs (use once a week) and avoid those with crushed walnut shells or abrasive ingredients. For everyday cleansing, here’s what to look for: This term frequently appears on product labels and is used by skin-care experts but not always defined in simple, clear language. Here’s a quick explanation: If a product claims to be non-comedogenic it means that it shouldn’t clog pores or trigger acne — either by occluding the skin, blocking glands or irritating the hair follicle. The claim is not regulated by the F.D.A., however, and many companies do their own internal tests to determine whether a product should be considered comedogenic or not. (Some common known comedogenic ingredients are coconut oil and cocoa butter.) Typically, the fewer ingredients a product has, the easier it is to determine if it will cause any reactions.  Did you know there's a best way to wash your face? Here's how skin-care specialist Kristina Holey does it. For many, the word “toner” brings to mind stinging astringents from the ’80s. “The original was an alcohol-based product that was used to dry up oily skin and remove any leftover dirt following cleansing,” Dr. Nazarian says. Today’s formulas, however, have evolved. Think of them as supplements — these thin liquids deliver an extra shot of nutrients, helping the other products in your regimen absorb better, while still balancing your complexion. Most experts, the New York City aesthetician Jordana Mattioli says, consider toner to be optional: “It can be a good way to add in specific ingredients that you may not have in your other products or add another layer of skin-replenishment.” If you have the time and inclination, here are some hero ingredients to look for: “Toners should be done after cleansing and before putting on anything else,” Mattioli says. The traditional application method is to saturate a cotton pad and pass it over your face. But, as Mattioli points out, “You end up losing a lot of product.” 
Tip: “Applying toner with clean hands is the most efficient. Just pour a few drops in your palm, then swipe it on.” Or if you prefer, you can pull apart a cotton pad “so it’s not so thick before putting toner on it,” Mattioli advises. Most formulas can be used morning and night, but you might want to use those with exfoliating acids only at night or every other day.  October 10, 2016June 3, 2016January 9, 2017Simply put, serums are powerful skin allies. Filled with concentrated doses of active ingredients, these elixirs can mitigate a number of issues, from dark spots to wrinkles. “Even if you don’t have any specific issues, everyone still needs a general antioxidant serum in the morning to protect from daily aggressors,” Mattioli says. While there are “limitless options” for ingredients, Nazarian singles out her hardworking favorites. To handle specific issues, look for these products:  If you have multiple concerns, you might want to use multiple formulas. “I recommend treating different areas with different products,” Mattioli says. “Maybe you’ll use a vitamin C serum all over but then dab on [another] for hyperpigmentation on just a few spots.” Just run any combination by your dermatologist to avoid any potential reactions. To save time, don’t try mixing a serum into your moisturizer. This “lessens the ability of the serum to absorb effectively,” Dr. Nazarian says. “Products should be applied one by one.” Not all serums are applied with the same frequency. “This varies with the ingredients,” Dr. Nazarian says. “I prefer antioxidants in the morning because they give you additional protection from the environment, and most of us don’t use enough sunscreen as is,” Mattioli says. Yet certain ingredients are best when slathered on at night. For example: “Retinols are not sun-stable and will degrade if applied in daytime,” Dr. Nazarian explains. Bottom line: Read the label instructions carefully.The most basic function of a moisturizer is to hydrate and soften the skin. “Essentially, moisturizers assist in preventing water loss through the outer layers of skin,” Dr. Charles explains. “They can also complement the naturally found protective oils and other building blocks within the skin, such as ceramides.” This is one product that doctors recommend using year-round, for all skin types. “Skin naturally loses the ability to retain moisture as we age,” Dr. Nazarian insists, “and daily activities, such as washing, can strip natural hydrators from the surface.”“Everyone needs moisture, but the texture of your moisturizer will differ depending on your skin type,” Mattioli notes. Consider this your cheat-sheet, courtesy of Dr. Nazarian.Creams you apply in the morning are equipped to protect your skin from the environmental aggressors you’ll face when you leave the house—many contain antioxidants to minimize pollution-based free radicals and sunscreen to shield you from ultraviolet radiation. They typically have a lightweight consistency. Night creams, on the other hand, focus on repairing any damage you might have picked up with ingredients like retinol to speed cellular turnover and counteract dark spots. These creams also replenish moisture levels, which naturally dip in the evening, with emollients that often create a rich, thick texture. Can you survive without an eye cream? Absolutely. But, if you have specific concerns — like hyperpigmentation, dryness or puffiness — you might want to try one. “The skin around the eyes is quite thin and delicate, and more likely to react to irritating ingredients than other areas,” Dr. Nazarian says. “Therefore, dermatologists typically recommend an eye cream that considers the potential sensitivity and has more tolerable concentrations of active ingredients.” 
For undereye bags and inflammation, caffeine, peptides and hyaluronic acid can be soothing, Mattioli says. “Dark circles can be due to visible veins or actual discoloration common in darker skin tones,” she says. “Look for brightening ingredients like vitamin C, kojic acid and niacinamide.” Insider tip: Steer clear of strong retinols (which can sting and create redness) and fragrance, to avoid any eye irritation.   “Everyone needs moisture, but the texture of your moisturizer will differ depending on your skin type,” Mattioli notes. Consider this your cheat-sheet, courtesy of Dr. Nazarian.All of the experts we consulted unanimously agreed on one thing: that sunscreen is, hands down, the most crucial skin-care product. It’s “of utmost importance as part of your year-round regimen,” Dr. Charles points out. “Daily and consistent sunscreen use helps to prevent the development of fine lines and wrinkles, textural imperfections, and changes in the appearance of pores over time. More importantly, daily sunscreen use can help to prevent the formation of certain skin cancers.” To make it easy to remember, experts recommend using a daily moisturizer with a built-in broad spectrum SPF of at least 30.There’s a lot of debate over which sunscreens are best and safest for your complexion. You have two types of ingredients in formulas: Pros:Cons:Pros:Cons:Insider tip: “I typically advocate the use of sunscreens that contain a combination of physical and chemical blocking components,” Dr. Charles says. “These will provide protection from both UVA and UVB rays, and typically do not create any visible residue.”  Consider this your rule of thumb, according to Dr. Nazarian: “Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before sun exposure, and reapply at least every two hours. Chemical sunscreens should be applied directly to clean skin, while physical blockers can be applied last in your skin-care regimen, but before makeup is applied. About two tablespoons of sunscreen are appropriate to cover your face and exposed areas of your body; within that amount, use a nickel-size dollop to cover your face.”All of the experts we consulted unanimously agreed on one thing: that sunscreen is, hands down, the most crucial skin-care product. It’s “of utmost importance as part of your year-round regimen,” Dr. Charles points out. “Daily and consistent sunscreen use helps to prevent the development of fine lines and wrinkles, textural imperfections, and changes in the appearance of pores over time. More importantly, daily sunscreen use can help to prevent the formation of certain skin cancers.” To make it easy to remember, experts recommend using a daily moisturizer with a built-in broad spectrum SPF of at least 30.January 19, 2017July 25, 2016June 3, 2013To say that face masks have become popular lately is a bit of an understatement — Sephora has more than 400 varieties (and 60 of those launched in the last few months). Masks “offer highly concentrated treatments to address specific issues,” says New York City dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner. But unlike a toner or a serum, masks deliver ingredients under occlusion, which helps the ingredients absorb more efficiently, notes Dr. Nazarian. 
Then there’s the fun factor: Many of the latest innovations bubble up, turn colors and peel off. Yes, it’s a little gimmicky, and this step is certainly not essential in your routine. “Think of masks like boosters — not necessary but beneficial,” Mattioli says. 
If you want to give one a whirl, here are three performance-driven varieties to consider, according to Mattioli:
Sheet masks: “These are primarily hydrating. Having ingredients saturated on the skin in this occlusive manner keeps air from getting in and you’ll get a higher absorption in a short amount of time. I always recommend keeping these in the fridge to get an anti-inflammatory benefit as well.”
Sleeping packs or overnight masks: “Overnight masks or sleeping packs will have a thicker texture and help trap in whatever ingredients you layer underneath. They’re ideal for mature skin or severely dry skin.”
Clay or mud masks: ""These absorb oil and can have a mild exfoliating effect — so they’re great for oily areas. You don’t have to put it on your whole face, though. You can target just a few areas. In fact, I love multi-masking: using a clay on the t-zone and a hydrating one everywhere else.”   Insider tip: Apply masks after serum but before moisturizer, unless it’s a leave-on overnight mask, which can take the place of your nighttime moisturizer. Like any product that supplements your regular routine, masks should be used in moderation — no more than once a week to prevent any irritation, Dr.  Zeichner says.Not really. A simple washcloth really does most of the work. But who needs a spa appointment when the latest skin-care gadgets — and one surprisingly analog standby — bring the same technology to your bathroom?
Here are a few we recommend:   
Washcloth: Lightly buffing with a standard-issue (100-percent cotton) clean cloth and gentle cleanser might be all you need for smoother skin. To avoid any bacteria, use a fresh cloth every day.  
Sonic cleansing: A rotating disc emits pulsations that dislodge impurities from your pores. Most tools come with multiple settings for a gentle to deep clean. [Clarisonic Mia 1 Facial Cleansing Brush, $129]
LED light therapy: Many devices combine multiple colored lights in one wand, so you can customize your session. Switch on red to stimulate collagen and elastin production while decreasing inflammation; blue to eliminate acne-causing bacteria and redness; and yellow to even out your tone.  [Skin Inc Optimizer Voyage Tri-Light, $265]
Microcurrent waves: A low-level current sends waves through the skin to tighten and contour the facial muscles — think of it as a workout for your complexion. [NuFace Trinity Facial Toning Device, $325] 
Fractional non-ablative laser: Beams of light penetrate the skin (creating a warm, but not burning, sensation) to generate cellular disruption, which triggers the body’s natural healing process to fight off lines and wrinkles. [Tria Beauty SmoothBeauty Laser, $495]Touted as a pure and natural way to improve your skin, botanical facial oils — infused with plant and farm-fresh extracts — have exploded into the mainstream market lately. Still, experts often advise caution when dousing yourself, as not all oils are created equal. “I recommend avoiding essential oils or those with added perfumes, which increase potential of skin irritation,” Dr. Nazarian says. 4 Benefits of Facial Oils: How and When to Use an Oil:Most facial oils can be used twice daily, both morning and night. They should be applied after facial serums and gels, but before your creams and lotions. Spread a dime-size amount between your palms and pat it on, targeting the outer areas of the face, and then sweeping in toward the center, around your eyes, nose and lips.Many times skin irritation, from acne to eczema, can be traced back to overzealous habits. “Unfortunately, a lot of what I do is get people back to having healthy skin from overuse of products — stripping cleansers, items that over-exfoliate or contain sensitizing ingredients — which they were using as a foundation for healthy skin but it took them farther away from it,” Holey says. To bring your skin back to its baseline, she suggests the following holistic remedies:

Enter, a dermatologist. Well, more like 11 dermatologists who have generously shared some of their best skin-care tips with us.Now, these aren't your run-of-the-mill skin-care tricks, but rather rules they've learned and recommended to patients throughout their careers. For example, when and where to wear sunscreen (answer: everywhere and always), how to layer your skin-care products, and why chemical peels could be an important part of your routine.Keep reading to learn one (or 21) new skin-care tips and tricks — all approved by dermatologists.Everyone's skin suffers from periods when nothing is working. But masks balance skin quickly: Clays reduce oil, and gels calm redness. —Ellen MarmurIf you wake up with dry skin, change your bedtime routine, not the morning one. It’s easier to head off dryness at night than to reverse it the next day. —Doris DayFace wipes may be more convenient than old-school cleansers, but don't rely on wipes to detox skin if you live in a city where pollution is high. —Zoe DraelosYou don't have to use one product on your entire face. Try glycolic acid on the T-zone to minimize breakouts and thick creams elsewhere. —Dendy EngelmanWhen layering, let each product absorb for two or three minutes so it's not counteracted or diluted by the next one you put on. —Neil SadickNinety percent of fine lines are caused by sun exposure, which makes sunscreen the ultimate ingredient for younger-looking skin. Use an SPF 30 or higher daily. —DayWeekly chemical peels help healthy bacteria grow. Gritty scrubs have the opposite effect, triggering collagen-destroying enzymes. —Whitney BoweNew to chemical peels? Try glycolic acid for normal skin, salicylic acid for oily or combination skin, and gentle lactic acid for dry or sensitive skin. —DayUse brighteners (we like vitamin C) within six months of seeing a dark spot. Melanin goes deeper into skin over time, so it's harder to reach. —Jessica WuIf you're breaking out along your hairline, it could be from the oil in your hair products. A foaming face wash cuts through the oil without being harsh. —Patricia WexlerSheet masks push hydrating ingredients into the skin. Put one on over your moisturizer for 10 minutes at night, and your skin will be dewy the next day. —DayUsing retinol is a marathon, not a sprint. It stimulates collagen but can irritate. Start using it once per week, over a moisturizer. —Joshua ZeichnerBenzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes bacteria; use it all over to prevent breakouts. A 2.5 or 5.5 percent formula works without flaky side effects. —William JamesSalicylic acid is really only ideal for blackheads and whiteheads. If it dries you out, look for it in a face wash and let it sit on your skin for 30 seconds. —ZeichnerYour skin uses omega fatty acids to produce lipids (moisturizing oils) and studies show that omega-3 supplements improve skin's lipid levels and hydration. —WuDon't forget sunscreen on your ears, hairline, neck, hands, and chest. Dermatologists can look at your décolleté to see how old you are. —Ranella HirschIf you wake up to puffy eyes, add an extra pillow under your head while you sleep — gravity drains enough fluid to help with next-day puffiness. —ZeichnerGlycolic acid treats lines and dark spots. It's most effective in individually wrapped peel pads  (the pH of glycolic acid can change when it’s exposed to air). —WuIf your skin is ashy, make one easy change: Don't dry it completely before moisturizing. Creams seal in hydration and work best with a little water. —HirschDryness, redness, and tight skin are signs that you may need to switch to a higher SPF. Try a new sunscreen and see if the issues go away in a few days. —SadickTreat dark spots using antioxidants during the day. At night, apply topical retinoids to enhance cell turnover to shed pigment. —ZeichnerA version of this article originally appeared in the April 2019 issue of Allure.

40,https://www.myupchar.com/en/beauty,"We all have our idea of physical beauty. (To be clear from the start, this article is not about inner beauty or becoming a better person - although that is also the subject of some excellent research.)To some of us, an athletic body is the epitome of beauty. To others, thick hair, big eyes and sharp features are beautiful. And others still might be won over by glowing skin and a gorgeous smile. Of course, our ideas of beauty are informed by our cultural influences and biases.So how do we arrive at a consensus on what makes someone beautiful? The dictionary defines beauty as ""a combination of qualities, such as shape, colour, or form, that pleases the aesthetic senses, especially the sight"". For the purpose of this article, we are equating beauty to health. Healthy hair is beautiful hair. Healthy skin is beautiful skin. A healthy body is a beautiful body. And a healthy mind is a beautiful mind.The following are some of the components of achieving health and beauty:Our skin is the biggest organ in the body. As air pollution grows in our cities, it needs a lot of extra care and nourishment. The same goes for our hair and nails.We have many traditions in India around skincare: many of us have grown up having our moms apply malai or besan or multani mitti on our skin. The benefits of neem and neem oil, turmeric, sandalwood, rosewater, aloe vera and aloe vera gel for skin have also been known in Indian households for many decades.Marrying traditional knowledge with scientific breakthroughs, to find a skincare routine that works for you is the key. Start by determining your skin type and work your way up from there to find solutions for reducing signs of ageing, for glowing skin, etc.Similarly for hair, start by figuring out if you have oily hair, dry hair or normal hair. Then, build a hair care routine that is specific to your hair type and conditions. You can even try home remedies for hair growth and to promote healthy hair.New discoveries are made every day. These discoveries help us understand what makes our skin youthful and wrinkle-free and our hair smooth and shiny. For example, we now know that hyaluronic acid helps to moisturise the skin as few other things can and biotin (essentially vitamin B7) helps to strengthen the hair. Staying up to date on scientific research on healthy skin, hair, nail and body weight can help you make better choices for greater beauty.As for beauty products, there are a few rules of thumb you should keep in mind:Beauty treatments, from keratin treatment for hair to micro-needling, can also help to achieve healthier and more beautiful hair and skin - it is a good idea to talk to a dermatologist or cosmetologist before opting for chemical treatments such as platelet-rich plasma treatment and chemical peels. Some treatments, like nail art and eyelash extensions, don't serve a health purpose (except to give your confidence and happiness a short-term boost - these are important goals, too). That said, it is important to keep the risk factors and precautions in mind before opting for any such treatments.There are also simple, inexpensive home remedies for a range of skin and hair problems. For example, home remedies to stop hair fall, home remedies for acne (pimples), home remedies to prevent wrinkles that can also enhance beauty. Read all about them in the articles that follow!A body that is free from disease is a healthy body. And a healthy body is the most important aspect of beauty. When we are healthy in the true sense of the word, our skin looks and feels beautiful, our hair looks and feels luscious and our body stays in proportion (good form).Conversely, someone who is ill may look pale and sickly. They may experience hair fall or premature greying as symptoms of their disease. Swelling and acne - which are also common symptoms of some diseases - may affect their skin.Now, there are some things that are out of our control. For example, if we have a family history of diabetes, then we will be more prone to the disease. Still, there are things that are within our control, such as exercise for a healthy body.Research has shown that just 35 minutes of brisk walking, three or four days a week has tremendous benefits for the body and mind. While this is bare minimum everyone should do, people who want an athletic body should do a mix of strength training and cardio workouts like swimming, cycling and running. Compound exercises, functional exercises and bodyweight exercises are also excellent for staying fit and beautiful.We are what we eat. A balanced diet with whole grains, legumes, eggs, dairy, fish, chicken, nuts and seeds, and five portions of fruits and five portions of vegetables a day provides all the macro and micronutrients we need for beautiful hair and skin.Studies have shown that stress is the underlying factor in a number of diseases. It also causes greying of hair and speeds up the signs of ageing on the skin. Managing stress, through meditation or yoga, can do wonders for your beauty care routine, too.While the idea of beauty may be different for different people, we can all aim towards better health as a way to becoming the most beautiful version of ourselves. Here's to being - and feeling - beautiful!

42,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-acne-remedies,"We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process.Acne is one of the most common skin conditions in the world, affecting an estimated 85% of young adults (1).Conventional acne treatments like salicylic acid, niacinamide, or benzoyl peroxide are proven to be the most effective acne solutions, but they can be expensive and have undesirable side effects, such as dryness, redness, and irritation.This has prompted many people to look into remedies to cure acne naturally at home. In fact, one study found that 77% of acne patients had tried alternative acne treatments (2).Many home remedies lack scientific backing, and further research on their effectiveness is needed. If you’re looking for alternative treatments, though, there are still options you can try.This article explores 13 popular home remedies for acne.Acne starts when the pores in your skin get clogged with oil and dead skin cells.Each pore is connected to a sebaceous gland, which produces an oily substance called sebum. Extra sebum can plug pores, causing the growth of a bacteria known as Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes.Your white blood cells attack P. acnes, leading to skin inflammation and acne. Some cases of acne are more severe than others, but common symptoms include whiteheads, blackheads, and pimples.Many factors may contribute to the development of acne, including:Standard clinical treatments are the most effective for reducing acne. You can also try home treatments, though more research on their effectiveness is needed. Below are 13 home remedies for acne.Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple cider, or the unfiltered juice from pressed apples.Like other vinegars, it’s known for its ability to fight many types of bacteria and fungi (3, 4).Apple cider vinegar contains organic acids, such as citric acid, that have been found to kill P. acnes (5).Research has shown that succinic acid, another organic acid, suppresses inflammation caused by P. acnes, which may prevent scarring (6).Lactic acid, another acid in apple cider vinegar, may also improve the appearance of acne scars (7, 8).While certain components of apple cider vinegar may help with acne, there’s currently no evidence to support its use for this purpose. Some dermatologists advise against using apple cider vinegar at all, as it may irritate the skin.It’s important to note that applying apple cider vinegar to your skin can cause burns and irritation. If you choose to try it, use it in small amounts and dilute it with water.The organic acids in apple cider vinegar may help kill acne-causing bacteria and reduce the appearance of scars. Applying it to the skin may cause burns or irritation, so it should be used carefully.Zinc is an essential nutrient that’s important for cell growth, hormone production, metabolism, and immune function.It’s relatively well studied compared with other natural treatments for acne.Research indicates that people with acne tend to have lower levels of zinc in their blood than those with clear skin (9).Several studies have also shown that taking zinc orally may help reduce acne.For example, a 2014 review found that zinc is more effective at treating severe and inflammatory acne than treating moderate acne (10).The optimal dosage of zinc for acne has not been established, but several older studies have observed a significant reduction in acne using 30–45 mg of elemental zinc per day (11, 12, 13).Elemental zinc refers to the amount of zinc that’s present in the compound. Zinc is available in many forms, and they contain varying amounts of elemental zinc.Zinc oxide contains the highest amount of elemental zinc at 80%.The recommended safe upper limit of zinc is 40 mg per day, so it’s probably best to not exceed that amount unless you’re under the supervision of a medical doctor.Taking too much zinc may cause adverse effects, including stomach pain and gut irritation.It’s also important to note that applying zinc to the skin has not been shown to be effective. This may be because zinc is not effectively absorbed through the skin.Individuals with acne tend to have lower zinc levels than people with clear skin. Several studies suggest that taking zinc orally may reduce acne.Honey and cinnamon have the ability to fight bacteria and reduce inflammation, which are two factors that trigger acne (14, 15).A 2017 study found that the combination of honey and cinnamon bark extract exerted antibacterial effects against P. acnes (16).Other research has indicated that honey on its own can block the growth of or kill P. acnes (17).Although, this finding doesn’t necessarily mean that honey effectively treats acne.A study in 136 people with acne found that applying honey to the skin after using antibacterial soap was no more effective at treating acne than using the soap on its own (18).While the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of honey and cinnamon may reduce acne, more research is needed.Honey and cinnamon have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. They may help reduce acne, but more studies are needed.Tea tree oil is an essential oil that’s extracted from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a small tree native to Australia.It’s well known for its ability to fight bacteria and reduce skin inflammation (19, 20).What’s more, several studies have found that applying tea tree oil to the skin may reduce acne (21, 22, 23).Another small study found that, compared with benzoyl peroxide, participants using a tea tree oil ointment for acne experienced less dry skin and irritation. They also felt more satisfied with the treatment (24).Given that topical and oral antibiotics can cause bacterial resistance if used long term for acne, tea tree oil may be an effective substitute (21).Tea tree oil is very potent, so always dilute it before applying it to your skin.Tea tree oil has strong anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Applying it to the skin may reduce acne.Green tea is very high in antioxidants, and drinking it can promote good health.It may also help reduce acne. This is likely because the polyphenols in green tea help fight bacteria and reduce inflammation, which are two main causes of acne (25).There isn’t much research exploring the benefits of drinking green tea when it comes to acne, and more studies are needed.In one small study with 80 women, participants took 1,500 mg of green tea extract daily for 4 weeks. By the end of the study, women who took the extract had less acne on their noses, chins, and around their mouths (26).Research has also found that drinking green tea may lower blood sugar and insulin levels, which are factors that can contribute to the development of acne (27).Many studies also indicate that applying green tea directly to the skin may help with acne.Research shows that the main antioxidant in green tea — epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) — reduces sebum production, fights inflammation, and inhibits the growth of P. acnes in individuals with acne-prone skin (28).Multiple studies have found that applying green tea extract to the skin significantly reduces sebum production and pimples in those with acne (29, 30, 31).You can buy creams and lotions that contain green tea, but it’s just as easy to make your own mixture at home.You can also add the remaining tea leaves to honey and make a mask.Green tea is high in antioxidants that help fight bacteria and reduce inflammation. Some research indicates that applying green tea extract to the skin may reduce acne.Witch hazel is extracted from the bark and leaves of the North American witch hazel shrub, Hamamelis virginiana. It contains tannins, which have strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties (32, 33).That’s why it’s used to treat a broad range of skin conditions, including dandruff, eczema, varicose veins, burns, bruises, insect bites, and acne.Currently, there appears to be very little research on witch hazel’s ability to treat acne specifically.In one small study funded by a skin care company, 30 individuals with mild or moderate acne used a three-step facial treatment twice daily for 6 weeks.Witch hazel was one of the ingredients in the second step of the treatment. Most participants experienced significant improvement in their acne by the end of the study (34).Research also suggests that witch hazel may fight bacteria and reduce skin irritation and inflammation, which can contribute to acne (35, 36, 37).It’s important to note that commercially prepared versions may not contain tannins, as they are often lost in the distillation process.Shop for witch hazel online.Applying witch hazel to the skin may reduce irritation and inflammation. It may be beneficial for individuals with acne, but more research is needed.Aloe vera is a tropical plant whose leaves produce a clear gel. The gel is often added to lotions, creams, ointments, and soaps.It’s commonly used to treat abrasions, rashes, burns, and other skin conditions. When applied to the skin, aloe vera gel can help heal wounds, treat burns, and fight inflammation (38).Aloe vera contains salicylic acid and sulfur, which are both used extensively in the treatment of acne. Research has found that applying salicylic acid to the skin reduces acne (39, 40, 41, 42).Several studies have also indicated that aloe vera gel, when combined with other substances like tretinoin cream or tea tree oil, may improve acne (43, 22).While research shows promise, the anti-acne benefits of aloe vera itself require further scientific research.You can also buy aloe vera gel from the store, but make sure that it’s pure aloe without any added ingredients.When applied to the skin, aloe vera gel can help heal wounds, treat burns, and fight inflammation. It may be beneficial for individuals with acne, but more research is needed.Omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats that offer a multitude of health benefits.You must get these fats from your diet, but research shows that most people who eat a standard Western diet don’t get enough of them (44).Fish oils contain two main types of omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).High levels of EPA and DHA have been shown to decrease inflammatory factors, which may reduce the risk of acne (45).In one study, 45 individuals with acne were given omega-3 fatty acid supplements containing both EPA and DHA daily. After 10 weeks, their acne decreased significantly (46).There’s no specific recommended daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that healthy adults consume around 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA each day (47).You can also get omega-3 fatty acids by eating salmon, sardines, anchovies, walnuts, chia seeds, and ground flax seeds.Learn more about fish oil supplements.Fish oils contain two main types of omega-3 fatty acids — EPA and DHA. Taking a fish oil supplement may help decrease acne.Exfoliation is the process of removing the top layer of dead skin cells. You can use chemicals to achieve this, or exfoliate mechanically by using a brush or scrub to physically remove the cells (48).Exfoliation may improve acne by removing the skin cells that clog pores.It may also make acne treatments for the skin more effective by allowing them to penetrate deeper, once the topmost layer of skin is removed.Currently, the research on exfoliation and its ability to treat acne is limited.Some studies suggest that microdermabrasion, a method of exfoliation, can improve the skin’s appearance, including some cases of acne scarring (49, 50).In one small study, 38 patients with acne received eight microdermabrasion treatments at weekly intervals. The participants with acne scars showed some improvements following the treatments (51).Another small study found that six weekly microdermabrasion treatments helped stimulate skin repair (52).While these results indicate that exfoliation may improve skin health and appearance, more research is needed on acne. There are a wide variety of exfoliation products available, but you can also make a scrub at home using sugar or salt.Note that mechanical exfoliation, such as with harsh scrubs or brushes, can be irritating and damage the skin. As such, some dermatologists recommend gentle chemical exfoliation with salicylic- or glycolic-acid-based products.If you choose to try mechanical exfoliation, be sure to gently rub your skin to avoid damaging it.Exfoliation is the process of removing the top layer of dead skin cells. It may reduce the appearance of scars and discoloration, but more research needs to be done on its ability to treat acne.The relationship between diet and acne has been debated for years.Research suggests that dietary factors, such as insulin and glycemic index, may be associated with acne (53).A food’s glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly it raises your blood sugar.Eating high GI foods causes a spike in insulin, which likely increases sebum production. As a result, high GI foods may directly affect the development and severity of acne.Foods with a high glycemic index include processed foods, such as:Foods with a low glycemic index include:In one study, 66 people followed either a normal or low glycemic diet. After 2 weeks, the individuals consuming a low glycemic diet had lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone involved in acne development (54).Another study in 64 people found that those with moderate or severe acne ate diets with more carbohydrates and a higher glycemic load than those without acne (55).These small studies suggest that a low glycemic diet may help those with acne-prone skin. Additional larger, longer studies are needed.Eating high glycemic foods may increase sebum production and contribute to acne. More research is needed to determine whether a low glycemic diet can treat or help prevent acne.The relationship between dairy and acne is highly controversial.Milk and dairy products contain hormones like IGF-1, which is associated with acne. Other hormones in milk may cause hormonal changes and lead to acne (53).One study in people ages 10 to 24 found that drinking whole milk three or more days each week was linked to moderate or severe acne (56).In another study including 114 participants, those with acne were found to drink significantly more milk than people who didn’t have acne (57).On the other hand, a study involving over 20,000 adults found no association between milk consumption and acne (58).Participants self-reported the data in these studies, so more research needs to be done to establish a true causal relationship.Finally, several research reviews have suggested an association between dairy consumption and acne (59, 60). The relationship between milk and acne needs further study.Some studies have found a positive association between drinking milk and acne. Limiting milk and dairy consumption may help prevent acne, but more research is needed.The link between stress and acne is not fully understood. The hormones released during periods of stress may increase sebum production and inflammation, making acne worse (61).Stress may also affect gut bacteria and cause inflammation throughout the body, which could be linked to acne (62).What’s more, stress can slow wound healing, which may slow the repair of acne lesions (63).Multiple studies have found an association between stress and acne (64, 65, 66). However, each of these studies was relatively small, so more research is needed.One study in 80 participants found no association between stress intensity and acne. However, it noted that acne severity may be related to people’s ability to cope with stress (67).Certain relaxation and stress reduction treatments may improve acne, but more research needs to be done (68).Hormones that are released during times of stress may make acne worse. Reducing stress may help improve acne.There’s little research on the effects of exercise on acne. Still, exercise affects bodily functions in ways that may help improve acne.For example, exercise promotes healthy blood circulation. The increase in blood flow helps nourish the skin cells, which may help prevent and heal acne.Exercise also plays a role in hormone levels and regulation (69, 70).Several studies have suggested that exercise can decrease stress and anxiety, both of which can contribute to the development of acne (71, 72, 73).The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get 150 minutes of aerobic exercise and engage in strength training activities two days per week (74). This can include walking, hiking, running, and lifting weights.Exercise affects several factors that may improve acne. These include promoting healthy blood circulation and helping reduce stress.Acne is a common problem with a number of underlying causes. Experts agree that conventional treatments like salicylic acid, niacinamide, or benzoyl peroxide are still the most effective, though some may find these irritating.Many people choose to try natural remedies. Most home remedies for acne have not been shown to be clinically effective, but they’re available as alternative treatment options.Nevertheless, you may want to consult a dermatologist if you have severe acne.Read this article in Spanish.

                What is acne?Acne (acne vulgaris, common acne) is a disease of the hair follicles of the face, chest, and back that affects almost all teenagers during puberty -- the only exception being members of a few primitive Neolithic tribes living in isolation. It is not caused by bacteria, although bacteria play a role in its development. It is not unusual for some women to develop acne in their mid- to late-20s.Acne vulgaris is typical teenage acne which is characterized by three types of lesions:Acne appears on the skin asOne can do a lot to treat acne using products available at a drugstore or cosmetic counter that does not require a prescription. However, for tougher cases of acne, one should consult a physician for treatment options.
Unlike common acne, rosacea is not primarily a plague of teenagers but occurs most often in adults (ages 30-50), especially in those with fair skin. Different than acne, there are usually no blackheads or whiteheads in rosacea.What causes acne?No one factor causes acne. Acne occurs when sebaceous (oil) glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated at the time of puberty or due to other hormonal changes. Sebum (oil) is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin. Associated with increased oil production is a change in the manner in which the skin cells mature, predisposing them to plug the follicular pore. The plug can appear as a whitehead if it is covered by a thin layer of skin, or if exposed to the air, the darker exposed portion of the plug is called a ""blackhead."" The plugged hair follicle gradually enlarges, producing a bump. As the follicle enlarges, the wall may rupture, allowing irritating substances and normal skin bacteria access into the deeper layers of the skin, ultimately producing inflammation. Inflammation near the skin's surface produces a pustule; deeper inflammation results in a papule (pimple); if the inflammation is deeper still, it forms a cyst.Here are some factors that don't usually play a role in acne:In occasional patients, the following may be contributing factors:What other skin conditions can mimic acne symptoms and signs?When should someone start acne treatment?Since everyone gets acne at some time, the right time to treat it is when it becomes bothersome or when the potential for scarring develops. This can be when severe acne flares suddenly, for mild acne that just won't go away, or even when a single pimple decides to show up the week before one's prom or wedding.How to get rid of acne (pimples)Moderation and regularity are good things, but not everyone can sleep eight hours, eat three healthy meals per day, and drink plenty of water a day. Probably the most useful lifestyle changes one can make is to never to pick or squeeze pimples. Playing with or popping pimples, no matter how careful and clean one is, nearly always makes bumps stay redder and bumpier longer. People often refer to redness as ""scarring,"" but fortunately, it usually isn't permanent. It's just a mark that takes months to fade if left entirely alone.Occasional visits to an esthetician who is an expert at safely removing blackheads during a facial can be beneficial.Despite what one might read in popular style and fashion magazines, there is no magic product or regimen that is right for every person and situation.Benzoyl peroxide causes red and scaly skin irritation in a small number of people, which goes away as soon as one stops using the product. Keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide is a bleach, so do not let products containing benzoyl peroxide come into contact with fabrics, leaving unsightly white spots on colored clothes, shirts, towels, and carpets.One cannot stop oil glands from producing oil. Even isotretinoin (Accutane, see below) only slows down oil glands for a while; they resume normal activity later. It is possible to get rid of oil on the surface of the skin and reduce the appearance of shine.How does a doctor treat acne?It's best to consult a primary care physician or dermatologist if an individual is unable to adequately control his or her acne. The goal of treatment should be the prevention of scarring (not a flawless complexion) so that after the condition spontaneously resolves there is no lasting sign of the affliction. Here are some of the options available:By clicking ""Submit,"" I agree to the MedicineNet Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.  I also agree to receive emails from MedicineNet and I understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet subscriptions at any time.Are there any home remedies for acne?What is the best skin care routine for acne?These are all good basic skin regimens that may help with the acne battle:How would you summarize current-day acne treatment?Treating acne requires patience and perseverance. Any of the treatments listed above may take two or three months to start working (even isotretinoin). Unless there are side effects such as excessive dryness or allergy, it is important to give each regimen or drug enough time to work before giving up on it and moving on to other methods. Using modern methods, doctors can help clear up the skin of just about everyone.Just hang in there. And don't pick. Please.Cupping is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that stimulates the flow of chi (qi, or energy) within the body. There are a few different types of cupping: air, fire, wet, and the sliding cups technique. Cupping purports to bring impurities to the skin's surface and remove toxins. Oftentimes, cupping leaves marks, or bruises, on the skin.Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a common skin disorder in which small white or red bumps appear around hair follicles on the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, and cheeks. The cause of KP is unknown. There is no cure for keratosis pilaris, and the condition may resolve on its own. Gentle exfoliation, professional manual extraction, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion, along with topical products, are the best treatments for this condition.©1996-2021 MedicineNet, Inc.

44,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/11/top-10-lockdown-beauty-tips-sali-hughes,"Try an avocado face mask, a home manicure or a jawline-enhancing beard, says Sali Hughes Dry your hands carefully (especially under rings, where contact dermatitis is common) after every wash, and apply hand cream (I love The Body Shop’s Hemp Hand Protector, £5). At night, mix some extra olive or avocado oil into the cream, slather on and cover your hands with cotton socks overnight. If hands become cracked, use Flexitol cracked heel balm, £5.09 (56g) in the same way.There’s something nice about letting hair do what it wants, within reason. My hairdresser, Luke Hersheson, agrees. “Stepping back from the blowdryer and straightening or curling iron is easier, saves time, preserves condition and very often looks better,” he says. The trick is to place hair where desired when soaking wet. “Comb it through, apply any product, part it where you like, tuck behind the ears, twist, shake it out – but then leave it alone until it’s dry. Then you can disturb it, taking a piece or two to style with tools, but don’t bother with the back – only the front matters in Zoom meetings.”As for cuts, no stylist wants you reaching for the scissors. “People should wait. Haircutting is really hard. This whole idea that you need to do it every six weeks is outdated – what your style evolves into is often more interesting,” says Hersheson. His team is offering tips and advice via one-to-one video consultations, for a £10 donation to an NHS charity, during the Covid-19 crisis. Book on hershesons.com.Don’t waste your eggs, ignore the internet’s devotion to turmeric unless you’d like to turn yellow, and don’t go near lemon, lime or vinegar as they can play havoc with your skin. If you want to nourish your face with non-greasy moisture, half a mashed avocado with a teaspoon of honey works fine (slather on and leave for 15 minutes before removing with a wet flannel). Adding a tablespoon of fresh plain yoghurt can impart an extra glow.1. Remove old polish and wash hands (but don’t apply hand cream).2. Choose something about an hour long to half-watch on television (this ensures you don’t get up too early and smudge).3. Clip or cut and, with an emery board, file nails in one direction only, into a “squoval” (square along the top, curved at the sides).4. Apply a thin layer of clear base coat.5. Apply colour. Remove the brush and stroke it on either side against the neck of the bottle (the brush should never be dripping) to get rid of surplus polish. Paint three strokes – left, middle, right – in the shape of a nail. This is very important: you should disregard your natural nail shape and leave small unpainted gaps between the sides of your nail and your skin. This looks heaps better than pools of polish in the gutters. Don’t worry about streaking at this stage; this coat is for colour density, not neatness. Leave to dry for a few minutes.6. Second coat. Repeat step five, this time taking great care not to streak. Stick to the shape you painted with the first coat and go nowhere near your nail beds, leaving a little gap all around the edges of polish. Move fast. Don’t go back and paint over polish you have just laid down. Wait at least 15 minutes.7. Apply clear topcoat, this time taking it over the colour’s edges to seal it, then finish whatever you were watching. You can clean up with a remover-soaked cotton bud, but avoid hand cream for a good hour.Take a nail file and file gently across the gel polish, to disturb the seal. Soak a small piece of cotton wool (try cutting discs into four triangles) in acetone, available cheaply in any chemist. Place the wet pad on to the nail, then “trap” it by wrapping in place with a piece of tinfoil (or special clips, widely available online). Leave for at least 10 minutes, preferably 20. Take an orange stick and gently scrape away the colour. Use a buffing file to remove any tiny fragments, then apply oil to nails and cuticles.For bearded men, social isolation may look like an enforced choice between clean shaven and ZZ Top, but good maintenance is perfectly possible when you know how. Expert groomer Jon Chapman has scrubbed up Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks and Daniel Craig over the years, and is a proud beard owner himself. “Beards shouldn’t go over an inch below the chin, preferably less,” he says. “Anything longer drags down the face, diminishes facial features, looks unprofessional and ages you.” A shorter beard keeps the jawline defined – ideal if you have gained a few extra pounds – and gives the illusion of smartness when your hair is in need of a cut. For trimming, Chapman suggests Wahl beard trimming clippers: “Accept no substitutes. They’re inexpensive, available everywhere and will last a lifetime.”On a slim face, you should hold a 3-4mm Kent comb at a 2 o’clock angle to the skin, and trim above it. For fuller faces, hold the comb vertically and clip downwards, leaving no more than a quarter of an inch of bristle. “Don’t forget the nose, ears and brows,” Chapman adds. As someone who routinely trims my husband’s brows, I find the best technique is to brush them upwards, trim any overlappers with nail scissors, then use small clippers to remove any traces of monobrow.Chapman doesn’t hold with beard oil unless someone has very thick, coarse bristles. Instead, he follows a good skincare routine and rubs his facial moisturiser well into his beard to keep it conditioned and tame. If you feel the need to colour it, Chapman urges caution to avoid the Lego-look: “Use two shades lighter than you think, do it in three stages, and fleck on the dye with an old toothbrush.”If you’re a die-hard salon waxer, you may currently be itching like mad. And while you may not have used it since the 80s, epilation cream can be a great solution when you don’t want a razor blade near your nethers. Just smooth on the cream (Nair’s Tough Hair, £4 for 200ml, is good), leave for a few minutes, then remove with the special tool or an old towel, buffing away the hairs. There are also cold wax strips if you feel brave – just make sure you’re wearing appropriate underwear, to avoid catching any skin that does not wish to be caught.If one of the few benefits of this period is not having to bother with hairstyling and makeup, then all power to you. But many of us feel better for the sense of structure and normality these beauty routines bring. A good compromise is “dress up Fridays”, where ponytails, bare faces and trackies can be upscaled once a week with a cursory blowdry, a face of makeup and a non‑elasticated waistband.Self-tan no one can see: why bother? “Because people have cancelled their holidays in the sun, and their weddings, and shouldn’t have to miss out on the golden glow, too,” says Jules von Hep, of Isle of Paradise. He has tanned Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, Stacey Dooley, and spent three years hosing down all the Strictly Come Dancing contestants. “When people look in the mirror, many of them want to see the person they saw before, and to observe the same rituals.”So if a little extra colour makes you more cheerful, then you will need to master it yourself – and this is the perfect time to practise. For Von Hep, that means thorough exfoliation for a smooth, even base. If you’re out of body scrub, mix a handful of brown sugar or coarse salt into body wash or olive oil, massage into skin, then shower. Straight afterwards is the best time to self tan. Von Hep believes in moisturising only hands, knees, elbows and feet, then leaving for five minutes to soak in. Then take your tan – tinted for beginners, clear for the more experienced – and saturate the skin with product. Put on a tanning mitt (or use a household sponge) and blend using sweeping, upward strokes, never circular motions. Do face, arms, legs and torso; for your back, either enlist a helper or tape the mitt to a wooden spoon to reach. Brush through brows with an old mascara wand and use an inside-out sports sock to buff around the hairline and ears to remove excess.Leave to dry, then repeat everywhere except your face, and wear loose, cool clothes for two to six hours. “Remember, tanning isn’t just for the pale,” adds Von Hep: darker shades of self-tan will give a glow to darker skin. “We’re all looking a little ashy right now from being indoors. And many of us are a little pink from drinking wine in the evenings. Tan will correct all that and restore your glow.” As you grow out that fringe or brows, consider upping your skincare game. Retinol can work wonders on acne and ageing skin, but many of us can’t face the inevitable two to four weeks of dryness, flaking and peeling as it takes effect. Now is your time to push through the peel barrier in the privacy of your own home. Gently does it: begin with a low-dose retinol (perhaps a 0.3%) applied every other night, then work up to nightly application. There are countless retinols available online; among my favourites are those by Medik8, Paula’s Choice, Estée Lauder and La Roche Posay. Skin texture should be better than normal within a month.

Apply daily SPF moisturizer year-round.Even though we may not be experiencing 100-degree weather in the fall, it’s still critical to protect your skin from excessive sun exposure. Apply SPF moisturizer before you head outside. Even if you’re in the shade, you can still get burned. Skin is delicate and can be damaged by UV rays during any type of weather.2.

Let's not forget: We love a dewy, glossy lid around here. But we also understand there's a delicate balance between a glowy, hydrated beat and one that looks, well, greasy. Oily eyelids often tip the scale toward the latter. You know exactly what we're talking about if you find your eyeliner streaking midday or your shadows never staying put. It's the very annoying issue of oily eyelids.If you're unsure how to manage your oily eyelids, experts have you and your shiny lids covered. Below, the best tips to mattify the oil and enhance your natural glow.According to board-certified dermatologist Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., creator of The Wellness Master Course, oily eyelids have quite a few causes. First, and perhaps most obvious, you may just have oily skin: ""Overproduction from oil by the sebaceous glands in the skin is one possible cause,"" Woolery-Lloyd notes. ""This is common in skin conditions like rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis,"" characterized by oily, flaky patches (which oftentimes afflict the delicate lid skin).  Second, you may have an overproduction of the meibomian glands—aka, those tiny oil glands along the edges of your upper and lower eyelids (right near your lashes). ""These glands produce oil to coat the eye, but when overactive can cause oily eyelids,"" Woolery-Lloyd notes. And, finally, you might be stripping the area with harsh skin care products, like cleanser. As you may know, when your skin is parched dry, it tends to respond with even more oil production to compensate. If you're a regular eye makeup wearer, you may be inadvertently doing this in the attempt to get off mascara or eyeliner at night. Make sure your cleanser or makeup remover isn't too stripping on the area. Oily eyelids aren't necessarily a bad thing (in fact, many makeup artists love the natural dewiness). That said, you don't have to do anything to mask your natural lid skin—rock those shiny lids! But if the excess oil does bother you, there are a number of ways to tone it down, as well as mattify the area with makeup tricks. Both skin care and makeup points, ahead: It's worth it to check up on your face wash, especially if you presume your skin might be parched dry. Even if you aren't necessarily scrubbing the eye area, your lids do react to whatever cleanser you choose, so make sure you're not unintentionally stripping the skin there. (Check out our favorite clean cleansers here.)If you feel your lids need some extra care, Woolery-Lloyd says you can take your gentle cleanser and massage it into the area. Just don't rub or tug! You never want to pull on the delicate lid skin, as you can create micro-tears and pave the way for wrinkles down the line.Or, Woolery-Lloyd says you can grab a cotton swab to swipe over the lids. ""A moistened [cotton swab] can also remove oily secretions,"" she notes. ""For skin conditions like rosacea, some doctors recommend cleaning the area with a diluted baby shampoo, while other doctors recommend cleansing with plain water."" Again, a light swipe is all you need—make sure not to tug too hard on the eye. Now, onto the makeup tips. If you're trying to knock down the oil, consider eyelid primer your new best friend. ""It only takes a few extra seconds to apply and makes all the difference by the end of the day,"" says makeup artist Alexandra Compton, product development manager at clean beauty retailer Credo. Bonus: A primer will help prevent creasing throughout the day and keep your makeup looking fresh. As the last step of your makeup routine, Compton notes, dab a little translucent setting powder over your lids to mattify any shine. Keep it on the go, and reapply whenever your lids are looking a bit greasy—the powder can soak up the excess oil with ease. If you find powder shadows too caky on oily lids, Compton also suggests investing in a liquid option that dries down to a powdery, nontransferable finish. It'll blend in seamlessly on your skin, yet it dries matte in mere minutes. A total win. ""I always say work with what you have as opposed to trying to combat it,"" says celebrity makeup artist AJ Crimson (a universal rule when it comes to natural-looking makeup, no?). So own the shine! To enhance your naturally dewy eyelids, he suggests accentuating them with just a dab of clean lip gloss (see here for full application instructions). ""If you already have this emollience working with you in that area, you don't have to go over the top. You get to use less product,"" he notes. If oily eyelids have you utterly frustrated, try managing the shine with oil-absorbing tricks and products. Of course, you can also accentuate the dew and work with your lids rather than against them—always a good move in our eyes.ILIA Beauty Liquid Powder Chromatic Eye TintILIA Beauty Liquid Powder Chromatic Eye TintAJ Crimson Beauty AJC Universal Finishing PowderAJ Crimson Beauty AJC Universal Finishing PowderAlima Pure Eye PrimerAlima Pure Eye PrimerWant your passion for wellness to change the world?

47,https://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/article/korean-skincare-tips-trends,"Follow usAll products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.By Hannah CoatesThe wonderful world of Korean beauty (or K-beauty as it’s known by beauty aficionados) has inspired countless beauty products in the UK and is responsible for improving how many of us approach our skincare routines. While once upon a time we simply cleansed, toned and moisturised, now we have serums, essences and a duo of cleansers to ensure our skin is spick and span – and that’s thanks to K-beauty. So what are the latest trends, tips and ingredients from our Korean counterparts that we can deploy for better skin? British Vogue spoke to Alicia Yoon, the founder of online K-beauty emporium Peach & Lily, to find out.You may already have heard about glass skin, one of the biggest skincare trends from the past year. The term describes skin that is glossy, glassy, luminous and translucent, explains Yoon, who launched the first-to-market Glass Skin Serum on Peach & Lily. In Korea, glass skin is more about a general attitude to skin: “It’s an awareness that the skin is your largest organ and that you need to care for it from within. Through that you achieve skin that’s so healthy that ultimately it looks like glass skin,” she says.Achieving a glass-skin effect, therefore, is all about working on the health of skin with a clever line-up of products. Peach & Lily offer a Glass Skin Discovery Kit, which comprises a hydrating (sulphate-free) cleanser, essence, serum (with peptides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid) and a lightweight, antioxidant-rich moisturiser – the building blocks of a healthy skincare routine. You can also try COSRX Low PH Good Morning Gel Cleanser, La Mer The Treatment Lotion, Allies of Skin Peptides & Antioxidants Firming Daily Treatment and Murad Nutrient-Charged Water Gel.“In Korea, people go to a dermatologist or aesthetician for facials once or twice a week – it’s like going to the gym – and now they want that facial experience from home for the days they aren’t in there,” says Yoon. For that, they rely on “home care”, which is created for them by their dermatologist and offers in-clinic results from home: cue post-facial skin literally every day of the week. Referencing the Miwaji Hyalu Serum Veil (contains everything from copper tripeptide to brightening arbutin) as a go-to home care product, Yoon says that super-products like these offer results akin to the facials themselves: “This product in particular imparts a thin, glue-like veil over skin that feels super comfortable. It’s the result of a dermatologist trying to recreate a hydrafacial for home use so it leaves skin plumped with hydration. I love it,” she says.A number of UK and US-based brands also offer skincare that mimics the effects of in-clinic treatments at home. Take Dr Dennis Gross’s Professional Grade IPL Dark Spot Concentrated Serum, which is designed to recreate the effects of IPL treatment on skin, fading dark spots and discolouration. Skincare tools that (effectively) imitate actual skincare treatments, like Sarah Chapman’s Pore Refiner, have also become popular. We’re more than au fait with keeping our immune system in check – thank you, vitamin C – but the Koreans are also concerned with their skin’s immunity: “Our skin plays an immune function role in keeping out bad bacteria,” says Yoon. “There’s an awareness in Korea about what you need to do to keep your skin immunity up and that’s keeping your skin barrier really strong.” Look to ingredients, such as fatty acids and ceramides, to help reinforce your skin barrier, keeping the good stuff in and the bad out. Sunday Riley’s ICE Ceramide Moisturising Cream is an excellent product to consider in your routine and deeply nourishes while keeping the skin barrier healthy and strong. By Hannah CoatesIs your skin dry… on the inside? That’s one thing that our Korean counterparts make it their mission to avoid: “We know that when our skin is dehydrated, it’s not caused by our lipid levels on the skin’s surface, but rather the moisture levels inside that are lacking,” says Yoon. It doesn’t matter what your skin type is – oily, dry, or sensitive – but if it’s dry on the inside, it won’t function at its best. Yoon explains: “When you’re dehydrated your melanocytes stay more activated and thus brightening ingredients may not work as well to reduce dark spots; it can also trigger an inflammatory response during which the hormone CRH is released, triggering more sebum production and breakouts; and your fibroblasts that produce collagen and elastin may not work as well. Hydration is the foundational to skin health.”To ensure skin is hydrated from the inside out, incorporate plenty of humectants in your skincare regime as these absorb into skin and help bind moisture in. Yoon recommends her brand’s Wild Dew Treatment Essence, which contains niacinamide, a cocktail of antioxidants, firming adenosine and three different sizes of hyaluronic acid to bind moisture into skin and give you your most hydrated and dewy-looking skin yet. Alternatively, try Tonymoly Ferment Snail Essence.The Korean one-minute rule refers to your skincare regime and the way in which you apply your product. The idea is to take one minute to massage your oil-based cleanser into skin (we love Sisley Triple Oil Balm Make-up Remover & Cleanser), spending time on getting the surface grime and day’s make-up to dissolve, and then to remove it and spend the next minute applying a hydrating formula. “If you don’t apply the subsequent hydrating formula within that minute, your skin becomes bone dry and formulas don’t absorb as much. It’s a great tip,” says Yoon.Troxerutin, the new ingredient to know, might be difficult to pronounce but it has sure made its mark in Korean skincare regimes. A super-antioxidant that is lauded for its ability to soothe irritation, reduce inflammation and hydrate, you can find it in Troxederm’s Repair Essence Mist where it’s blended with cica and niacinamide for an ultra calming effect. Yoon says it has gone totally viral in Korea: “All the celebrities started talking about it and Korea’s George Clooney bought $15,000 worth of this product for his fans – that’s how much he loves it.”More from British Vogue:By Hannah CoatesMore from VogueCondé Nast Britain© 2021 Condé Nast",6.56,10,4.4,8.8,3.04,1038

53,https://nurse.org/articles/skin-acne-masks-protective-hair-tips-for-nurses/,"ORNurses around the U.S. are experiencing problems with their skin and hair since the emergence of COVID-19. Wearing facemasks and PPE on a daily basis for 12+ hours has been causing some nurses to experience increased acne and dry skin. While washing hair daily with heavy detergents has been leading to hair loss and other hair problems. 
Nurses have been reporting the following problems with their skin and hair, 

Acne
Breakouts
Inflammation
Skin breakdown
Hair loss
Hair breakage
Dry hair

These are some of the effects nurses are experiencing from PPE. At the beginning of the year, we never imagined we'd have to get so resourceful with PPE. Nearly all PPE is designed for single use. Use it once and throw it away. PPE wasn't intended to be worn for hours, worn from patient to patient, or reused. A massive shortage of PPE and fear of running out caused many facilities to mandate PPE reuse. Nurses and other healthcare professionals wear the same PPE for entire shifts, and their skin and hair suffer the consequences. 
For skin, we asked two medical estheticians for their best maskne advice,

Jennifer Crampton-Walker, Master Esthetician and owner of Audrey's Holistic Skin Care in Seattle 
Nicole Baldwin, Licensed Medical Esthetician and certified environmental aging specialist

When it comes to hair, we chatted with 3 hairstylists, who specialize in a range of hair types,  to get their best tips and advice for nurses to protect their hair while at work,

1. Skin Care Tips For Nurses
Houston based licensed medical esthetician and certified environmental aging specialist Nicole Baldwin, provided us with an excellent recommendation for preventing and managing skin damage during COVID-19
Protecting Skin
PW: What can nurses do to protect their skin during this time?
NB: Nurses must be mindful of the cleansers they use. Over-washing the skin with soap and detergent-filled cleansers can strip away the skin's critical fat molecules and good bacteria leading to contact dermatitis (red and irritated skin). Strengthening the skin barrier is essential to healthy skin. Being continuously exposed to environmental aggressors damage the extracellular matrix, causing premature skin aging and other skin disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, and acne. Nurses and healthcare professionals need to use cleansers that:

Are hydrating
Are gentle
Stabilize the skin microbiome

Hydration is critical to protecting the skin against bruising and irritation caused by daily PPE wear. I recommend Caudalie Vinopure Pore Purifying Cleanser (Blemishes and oil control), Fresh Rose Cleansing Foam Face Wash (Hydration and Rejuvenation), and Biao Envirolution Anti-Pollution Micellar Foam Cleanser (neutralizes pollution residue and detoxifies skin cells) 
Preventing Breakouts 
PW: What can nurses do to prevent breakouts?
NB: First and foremost, it’s essential to know that breakouts are our body's way of informing us that something is going on internally. For example, in holistic medicine, we learn that breakouts above the nose area due to stress and breakouts below the nose area due to hormonal issues. Unhealthy eating from a hectic schedule can cause glycation (sugars in the bloodstream that form collagen, elastin, and other structural proteins in the skin) that damage the skin cells and cause breakouts. To prevent breakouts, it's vital to know what triggers your breakouts. Are they triggered internally or by contact with things such as:

Pollution buildup
Daily environmental aggressors
Unhealthy eating
Over-washing the skin
Prolonged wear of PPE

If the cause of your breakout is stress, engage in stress-relieving exercises such as mindfulness, spiritual prayer, or exercising to regulate cortisol hormones and Seborrheic dermatitis (dry skin) that promote acne and skin disorders.
A dermatologist should always address hormonal acne or symptoms found on the skin. Be sure to cleanse hands before applying PPE and after removing PPE to eliminate germs and bacteria from transmitting to your skin. I recommend using:

A nourishing skin care cleansing product such as Noxzema Facial Cleanser Moisturizing Cleansing.
A detoxifying face mask such as Boscia Black Charcoal Mask.
A recovery face mask such as the Biao Envirolution, Skin R&R Face Mask
A de-stressing face mask for stressed and fatigued skin. 

Finally, drinking lots of water daily is essential for purifying the skin and keeping it hydrated and healthy. Try to drink at least 1-gallon per day and watch as your skin transforms!
Skin Product Recommendations
PW: Do you have any product recommendations for different types of skin:

Oily
Sensitive
Dry
Combo
Acne or breakout-prone

NB:

Oily – Dr. Perricone Hypoallergenic Face Moisturizer
Sensitive – Base Butter Radiant Face Jelly
Dry Skin - Epara Cleansing Lotion 
Combo – Glossier Exfoliating Skin Perfector 
Acne or breakout-prone. – Rich and Clear Breakout Erase

Looking for skincare created by a nurse? Nurse Practitioner, Dr. Natash Welch, DNP created a skincare line, Abraza Skincare. Abraza treats:

Acne
Hair loss
Hyperpigmentation
Anti-aging 

12 Things You Can Do Right Now To Combat Maskne!
""I wear a mask at work everyday,"" says Jennifer Crampton-Walker, Master Esthetician and owner of Audrey's Holistic Skin Care in Seattle. ""Mask wearing is wreaking havoc on the skin of essential workers and healthcare professionals, alike. While it’s a small problem in the grand scheme, small problems are still problems.""
Jennifer shared these awesome tips to prevent and treat the dreaded ""maskne.""

Refrain from picking at your skin
Schedule time with your favorite esthetician
Leave the extractions to professionals
Avoid touching your face
Wash your hands before putting on a mask
Wear a breathable mask or one that is freshly washed
Get outdoors whenever possible
Try an Oxygen facial
Seek consultations with an MD or ND to test for vitamin deficiencies and hormone imbalances and find ways to minimize stress
High frequency and LED light therapy help kill acne-bacteria
Get adequate sleep (I know this can be difficult for nurses)
Drink lots of water (try for 1 gallon a day, if you can!) 

Recommended Skin-Care Routine  
Jennifer loves plant-based, high quality, holistic skin-care products. She recommends the following skincare routine with some of her favorite products, 

Use a deep-cleaning cleanser: Daily use of masks is trapping heat and, as a result, is causing excess moisture that affects our skin from a lack of exposure to fresh air. This, in turn, manifests the perfect storm of acne-causing bacteria, moisture and dead skin build-up. To combat this, I recommend upgrading to a professional skincare line and using a deep-cleaning cleanser. The Lyche Willow Bark cleanser from Sorella Apothecary is a natural exfoliator and pore minimizer that works wonders. 
Apply a non-stripping toner to your skin to balance it: Spiced Wine Toner from Sorella Apothecary boasts pumpkin extract, which is a natural, gentle product that exfoliates and removes superficial dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of pores. 
Finish with a bold moisturizer that won’t clog your pores: The Balm from Sorella Apothecary includes beeswax, which is a natural emollient and acts as a protective barrier for skin.
Use an exfoliating mask once or twice per week: Sorella Apothecary’s mint poppy seed polish acts as a two-in-one mask that exfoliates. It can be applied to the face with circular movements to remove dead skin cells with eco-friendly buffers to help brighten skin. You can relax with it on for 20-minutes as the natural kaolin clay draws out impurities. 






2. Haircare Tips For Nurses 
While some hair salons have slowly reopened, many women, especially those in healthcare, are finding difficulty caring for their hair. Here are a few tips to protect your hair.
Hair washing 
When we’re not in the middle of a pandemic it’s common (and recommended) to skip shampooing hair on a daily basis. Healthy air should maintain some of the natural oils and over-shampooing can dry out the hair. 
But, during these times, you might just feel better overall if you shampoo after your shift. In which case  it is recommended to use a mild, sulfate-free shampoo. If you need to wash daily, choose a shampoo that contains mild detergent and a pH that doesn't exceed 5.5. Scalp therapist, Bridgette Hill told Allure that over-shampooing could cause:

Dry, brittle hair
Dry, flaky scalp
Overproduction of unhealthy bacteria that trigger folliculitis

What to do if you have breakage, thinning, frizz or dryness
Experiencing hair breakage, thinning, excessive frizz, or dryness? Over-shampooing and heat damage are probably the culprits. By shampooing with sulfates and other harsh chemicals you are stripping the hair of the natural oils that it needs. The Curly Girl Method (CGM) has been growing in popularity because it helps all hair types (even straight hair) become healthy again and repair years of heat damage and harsh chemicals.
The method encourages its followers to relearn how to properly care for the hair and to limit some of the damaging hair care and styling methods we've been doing our entire lives. It takes some time to learn what's best for your hair, read more about the curly girl method here.
In the meantime, here are some of the basic guidelines for healthier hair, 

Stop shampooing every day and throw away all shampoo that contains sulfates. However, it is perfectly fine to co-wash! Co-washing is simply ""washing"" the hair with conditioner only. You can even find gentle cleansing conditioners that will still clean the hair without stripping it of the much-needed oils. If you have type 1-2 hair, it's fine to wash with a sulfate-free shampoo once or twice per week. 
Use a cleansing conditioner only to ""wash"" hair if you must wash multiple times per week. 
Stop using heat styling tools every day. You'd be surprised how damaging your beloved fat iron or curling iron are.
If you have wavy or curly hair (2a-4c type hair) do not comb or brush dry hair. Instead finger comb or use a wide-toothed comb to detangle conditioned hair while it is wet. 
Remove all shampoos, conditioners, and styling products that contain Sulfates, alcohol, non-water-soluble silicones and fragrance. Namely sodium lauryl sulfate & ammonium laureth sulfate.
Protect your hair while sleeping or when it is not styled. You may not know this but, your pillowcase could be damaging your hair and causing frizz! An easy fix is to purchase a satin or silk pillowcase or hair buff to cover the hair while sleeping. At work, you could wear a satin/silk bonnet under your hair cap. 
Do not dry your hair with a traditional towel. Towels create frizz and can cause breakage. Instead, opt for an old t-shirt or microfiber towel. 

Hairstyling products
Certain chemicals wreak havoc on the hair! It is recommended to stop using products that contain silicones, alcohol, and phthalates. You can find a list of products that work for your hair texture here. 
If your hair is oily, avoid the use of hair oils and gels. These products can attract dust and compromise the protection of your head cap or covering. And, if you’re not able to wash your hair, you can always opt for a dry shampoo. 
If you have curly hair, type 3b to 4c, it’s important to keep it moisturized. Founder of Curlss for the Girlss, Kennedy Johnson told Coveteur that hair needs water, just like a plant. Natural hair that ranges between 3b and 4c can use a little water every day. Johnson states she uses a mixture of jojoba oil and aloe in a mist to give her hair some moisture.
There are many drug store brands that now offer silicone-free and ""pure"" products, just make sure to check the label. The brand Not Your Mothers can be found at most drug stores and is a great low-cost option. Innersense is an organic haircare brand that smells wonderful and works wonders. 
Itchy scalp? 
If you have a flaky or itchy scalp, again, over-shampooing is probably to blame! Try dipping your head in a bowl on 1-part apple cider vinegar/ 1-part water or using a little tea-tree oil. And, throw away your silicone-containing shampoo. 
Your hair may also be lacking moisture.

Try a deep conditioning mask 
Add a little leave-in conditioner with water in a spray bottle and mist your hair every day
Use a little olive oil, coconut oil or jojoba oil on the scalp. 
Stop shampooing every day with harsh detergents and silicones, instead, use a cleansing conditioner or gentle non-drying shampoo.

3. Protective Hairstyles For Nurses To Wear To Work
These three hairstylists provided their recommendations for styles that are both trendy and protective,

French Braids, Fishtail Braids, Cornrows (all hair types)
Master Cosmetology instructor and owner of 903 Salon in Oklahoma City, Natasha Smith, suggests nurses with wavy, straight, or curly hair wear their hair braided, french braided, or in cornrows to protect the hair while at work. 
Master educator and stylist Diana Tracy Cotton tells us that braids are a fantastic option for all hair types due to the convenience of not having to do a daily hairstyle
A bonus is that braids can be low-maintenance and the hairstyle will last. For people with straight, wavy, or curly hair (type 1a to 3a) braids can last up to a week (depending on your particular hair and scalp) as long as the hair is wrapped up and doesn’t get wet."" You can also add some dry shampoo to the hair in between washes.  
People with curly and kinky hair (type 3a to 4c) can wear braids for months and can get wet. Braids will also hold up well underneath a head covering. If going multiple days or weeks without washing/shampooing your hair sounds uncomfortable, Smith recommends, ""using a good astringent such as witch hazel or dry shampoo.""

After dedicating her nursing career to creating content and solutions for employers that affected patient outcomes, these days Portia strives to empower nurses by offering resources for mental wellbeing--while empowering health-related businesses to grow their communities through engaging content that connects and converts. Follow her on Instagram and Twitter for her latest.Nurses around the U.S. are experiencing problems with their skin and hair since the emergence of COVID-19. Wearing facemasks and PPE on a daily basis for 12+ hours has been causing some nurses to experience increased acne and dry skin. While washing hair daily with heavy detergents has been leading to hair loss and other hair problems. Nurses have been reporting the following problems with their skin and hair, These are some of the effects nurses are experiencing from PPE. At the beginning of the year, we never imagined we'd have to get so resourceful with PPE. Nearly all PPE is designed for single use. Use it once and throw it away. PPE wasn't intended to be worn for hours, worn from patient to patient, or reused. A massive shortage of PPE and fear of running out caused many facilities to mandate PPE reuse. Nurses and other healthcare professionals wear the same PPE for entire shifts, and their skin and hair suffer the consequences. For skin, we asked two medical estheticians for their best maskne advice,When it comes to hair, we chatted with 3 hairstylists, who specialize in a range of hair types,  to get their best tips and advice for nurses to protect their hair while at work, Houston based licensed medical esthetician and certified environmental aging specialist Nicole Baldwin, provided us with an excellent recommendation for preventing and managing skin damage during COVID-19PW: What can nurses do to protect their skin during this time?NB: Nurses must be mindful of the cleansers they use. Over-washing the skin with soap and detergent-filled cleansers can strip away the skin's critical fat molecules and good bacteria leading to contact dermatitis (red and irritated skin). Strengthening the skin barrier is essential to healthy skin. Being continuously exposed to environmental aggressors damage the extracellular matrix, causing premature skin aging and other skin disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, and acne. Nurses and healthcare professionals need to use cleansers that:Hydration is critical to protecting the skin against bruising and irritation caused by daily PPE wear. I recommend Caudalie Vinopure Pore Purifying Cleanser (Blemishes and oil control), Fresh Rose Cleansing Foam Face Wash (Hydration and Rejuvenation), and Biao Envirolution Anti-Pollution Micellar Foam Cleanser (neutralizes pollution residue and detoxifies skin cells) PW: What can nurses do to prevent breakouts?NB: First and foremost, it’s essential to know that breakouts are our body's way of informing us that something is going on internally. For example, in holistic medicine, we learn that breakouts above the nose area due to stress and breakouts below the nose area due to hormonal issues. Unhealthy eating from a hectic schedule can cause glycation (sugars in the bloodstream that form collagen, elastin, and other structural proteins in the skin) that damage the skin cells and cause breakouts. To prevent breakouts, it's vital to know what triggers your breakouts. Are they triggered internally or by contact with things such as:If the cause of your breakout is stress, engage in stress-relieving exercises such as mindfulness, spiritual prayer, or exercising to regulate cortisol hormones and Seborrheic dermatitis (dry skin) that promote acne and skin disorders.A dermatologist should always address hormonal acne or symptoms found on the skin. Be sure to cleanse hands before applying PPE and after removing PPE to eliminate germs and bacteria from transmitting to your skin. I recommend using:Finally, drinking lots of water daily is essential for purifying the skin and keeping it hydrated and healthy. Try to drink at least 1-gallon per day and watch as your skin transforms!PW: Do you have any product recommendations for different types of skin:NB:Looking for skincare created by a nurse?

While some hair salons have slowly reopened, many women, especially those in healthcare, are finding difficulty caring for their hair. Here are a few tips to protect your hair.When we’re not in the middle of a pandemic it’s common (and recommended) to skip shampooing hair on a daily basis. Healthy air should maintain some of the natural oils and over-shampooing can dry out the hair. But, during these times, you might just feel better overall if you shampoo after your shift. In which case  it is recommended to use a mild, sulfate-free shampoo. If you need to wash daily, choose a shampoo that contains mild detergent and a pH that doesn't exceed 5.5. Scalp therapist, Bridgette Hill told Allure that over-shampooing could cause:What to do if you have breakage, thinning, frizz or drynessExperiencing hair breakage, thinning, excessive frizz, or dryness? Over-shampooing and heat damage are probably the culprits. By shampooing with sulfates and other harsh chemicals you are stripping the hair of the natural oils that it needs. The Curly Girl Method (CGM) has been growing in popularity because it helps all hair types (even straight hair) become healthy again and repair years of heat damage and harsh chemicals.The method encourages its followers to relearn how to properly care for the hair and to limit some of the damaging hair care and styling methods we've been doing our entire lives. It takes some time to learn what's best for your hair, read more about the curly girl method here.In the meantime, here are some of the basic guidelines for healthier hair, Hairstyling productsCertain chemicals wreak havoc on the hair!

54,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/style/celebrities-its-official-every-celeb-now-has-a-beauty-line.html,"AdvertisementSupported byskin deepSome new celebrity brands make sense, some don’t. What’s driving the trend?By Courtney RubinWhen Selena Gomez introduced her makeup brand Rare Beauty earlier this year, she was unable to promote it in person because of Covid. Instead, Ms. Gomez took on a role often delegated to a makeup artist: For Sephora, the brand’s exclusive retailer, she filmed all the education and training videos herself, iPhone in selfie mode, duct-taped to her bathroom mirror at home in Los Angeles.“She really wanted to show that anyone could use the makeup,” said Joyce Kim, the chief product officer at Rare Beauty. (A representative said Ms. Gomez was not available for an interview.)Ms. Gomez is one of the latest in a wave of celebrities no longer content to be a spokeswoman (as Ms. Gomez was for Pantene). They want to be beauty moguls. So they are, if you believe the hype, brainstorming new types of products. (Ms. Gomez’s Blot & Glow is a two-in-one compact with blotting papers and a powder-filled puff.) They are, in the case of Lady Gaga with Haus Laboratories, up until all hours doing mood boards and insisting that lipstick prices be brought down from $15 to $11 (according to Nicole Quinn, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners and one of her investors).Of course it’s hard to know exactly what and how much the celebrities do, only that seemingly everyone is doing it. Consider the Cosmopolitan headline: “10 Best Celebrity Beauty Brands of 2020 That Are Actually Good.” Besides Ms. Gomez, Issa Rae, the “Insecure” creator and star, announced that she is an owner of Sienna Naturals, a clean hair-care line for textured hair. Cardi B has a makeup line on tap. Lauren Conrad, who previously capitalized on her fame from the reality TV show “The Hills” to unveil clothing and bedding lines and even a New York Times best-selling novel, introduced Lauren Conrad Beauty, an eco-friendly vegan line of products.And on Nov. 25, Pharrell Williams’s new Humanrace line will offer what the singer/producer/entrepreneur calls a “three-minute facial” — three skin-care products designed for all genders.That’s just a fraction of the new wave. They join old guard (relatively speaking) of celebrity beauty moguls — and models of success — like Rihanna, whose Fenty Beauty generated an estimated $570 million in revenue in its first 15 months, not to mention releasing 40 (now 50) shades of foundation without even using the word “inclusive.”Or Kylie Jenner, whose Kylie Cosmetics lip kits sparked a flurry of other brands attempting to sell “kits” and “bundles” so customers could recreate a look. Ms. Jenner sold Coty a 51 percent stake in her company for $600 million. (Never mind that shareholders are now suing Coty for allegedly overpaying.)Money, of course.“In some instances maybe a very steady amount of money that can go on for years, after your acting career is over or diminished,” said Bruno Maglione, the president for licensing at IMG, which has recently created beauty lines for Dolly Parton, Brigitte Bardot and Paris Hilton. Starting your own company — à la Ms. Gomez, or Lady Gaga’s Haus Laboratories, which was introduced in 2019 — is generally more lucrative than a licensing deal (which Rihanna’s technically is), both of which can generate more cash than being a spokeswoman.There are also hybrid licensing deals, which offer some equity (Rihanna reportedly owns 15 percent of Fenty), along with the guaranteed royalty of the license.Going the start-up route also has the potentially huge prize down the road of an I.P.O. or a deal like Ms. Jenner’s, but not everyone has the stomach for it because “you can lose a boatload of money,” Mr. Maglione said — and yes, he means the star’s own.As for the licensing deals, he declined to discuss numbers. But documents filed in a copyright infringement lawsuit against Khroma Beauty offer a peek: Boldface Licensing + Branding paid Khloe, Kourtney and Kim Kardashian an advance of $1 million for licensing rights, with guaranteed minimum royalty payments of $4.6 million to $5.2 million, depending on the launch dates of various products. (Don’t remember Khroma? It was introduced in 2012, was promptly hit with multiple lawsuits for trademark infringement and lasted barely a year in stores.)Katie Slater, a partner at William Morris Endeavor who handles celebrity endorsements (she did Olivia Wilde’s deal with True Botanicals), also cited the money clients can make, along with the creative control they can exert. Instead of just turning up for shoots and P.R. days, stars can have a say in what is being said. Besides, doesn’t every star these days want to be a multi-hyphenate?Actors, Ms. Slater said, “are writing, directing, producing. They are building their own brands.”Whether this rush to create a brand is leading to some debuts that don’t seem authentic, or with products that aren’t actually wanted or needed, customers will decide.“You have to make something damn good and differentiated,” said Michael Yanover, the head of business development at Creative Artists Agency who helped start Haus Laboratories. “And is this the right product for this fan base?” (To measure a celebrity’s cultural influence and whether it can be converted to sales, CAA uses a proprietary and somewhat secretive analytics tool, CAA Intell.)Last year, customers quickly called out the teenage actress Millie Bobby Brown for a video she posted of her skin-care routine — she was trying to promote her new line — in which she wasn’t using the products (or even water), and her makeup remained intact. And Alicia Keys, who famously swore off makeup in 2016, will face the market with Keys Soulcare, a line of products that won’t be widely revealed until Dec. 3. Last month, Ms. Keys, a former spokeswoman for Proactiv skin care, promoted her new wares to a virtual V.I.P. lounge full of influencers and answered pre-vetted questions from beauty editors and TikTokers.“Alicia never swore off makeup,” said Kory Marchisotto, the chief marketing officer of e.l.f. Beauty, with which Ms. Keys has a licensing deal. “She had a moment of clarity where she wanted to break free from covering up. The makeup community turned that into their own narrative and made it a play against makeup.” Ms. Keys herself was not available to discuss until December, an e.l.f. representative said.Celebrities have long done licensing deals for fragrances (Rihanna and Gaga both had them), and in fact, celebrity perfume is the only sector of beauty to have posted growth this dark year. It’s up 2 percent, when every other category is well into negative double digits, according to the NPD Group research firm.But makeup and skin care are what’s hot for would-be moguls. They are bigger slices of the beauty industry — skin care alone accounts for anywhere from 45 to 60 percent of the profits, depending on which figures you use — and they are now easier to get into than ever. Thanks to e-commerce, they require less capital because there’s no need to hire a department store sales force to push products. And with social media, there’s a big savings on marketing, since a huge chunk of it is often the cost of the celebrity’s own time on Instagram.Beauty, and makeup in particular, is also a lot more straightforward than, say, clothing or homewares. There are no sizing issues, and it generally isn’t out of season as quickly, if ever. (Red lipstick, anyone?) The overhead is lower. And customers are open to buying a lipstick or an eyeliner from a celebrity in a way they may not be with skin-care products.“It’s ‘How can I trust that a celebrity knows the proper ingredients to go into skin care?’” said Larissa Jensen, a vice president at the NPD Group. “Makeup is much easier to create, to manufacture and to look at the celebrity in terms of makeup they typically wear, like is it a nude look or a bright look?” And beauty in general is a lot easier (read: cheaper) to buy as a fan than, say, Gwyneth Paltrow’s $1,999 pink velvet sofa, a collaboration with CB2.Venture capitalists also like celebrity beauty. Like all beauty, it has high margins, high repeat purchases and high customer word of mouth. And it’s easier to acquire a customer through a celebrity than it is through Facebook, Ms. Quinn of Lightspeed said. She looks not just for huge followings but at what the commenters are saying.“Are they saying, ‘Oh my God, you look so beautiful?” or are they saying: ‘Wow, it’s a really cool beach you’re on. Wish I were there,’” said Ms. Quinn, whose firm has invested in Jessica Alba’s Honest Company and Ms. Paltrow’s Goop. (“I was just talking to GP the other day,” she said.)With so many brands, it’s impossible for everyone to be successful, but don’t expect the pipeline to dry up anytime soon. Mr. Maglione of IMG said that some stars do hesitate because of fear of failure and possible damage to their reputation, but the sheer number of brands means that some misses aren’t even noted (though there are a few subreddits devoted to Tyra Beauty, Tyra Banks’s multilevel marketing company).As Gaga noted in a video she posted to social media: “The last thing the world needs is another beauty brand, but that’s too bad.”Illustration by Aleksandra Stanglewicz.

			 Covetable, lit-from-within radiance right this way!Pat McGrath is known as 'Mother' to iconic supermodels. She’s painted the faces of Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Madonna. She’s behind some of the most memorable looks on the runways  such as Christian Dior, Versace and Prada (glitter lips? Yeah, she made it popular!)Her luxury namesake brand Pat McGrath Labs launched to euphoric fanfare.  Oh, and the Queen made her a member of the Order of the British Empire for services to the fashion and beauty industry. A post shared by Pat McGrath (@patmcgrathreal)In short, makeup artist Pat McGrath is a legend. Her creativity is boundless as she turns various materials from jewels, sequins and feathers into showstopping looks that we can’t stop saving to our ‘inspiration’ folders. But underneath all the razzle dazzle, one fact remains: Pat McGrath is the queen of great skin. A post shared by Pat McGrath (@patmcgrathreal)So how does one create a flawless base that still looks real? We went straight to Pat for her backstage secrets, plus share some of the bestsellers from her luxury brand Pat McGrath Labs.This autumn, expect to see a gentler approach to glowing skin. “We’ve settled into a more real place. Ultra-shiny and ultra-matte are off the table for now,” Pat revealed.Plush skin, as she Pat it, is taking over the highly contoured and highlighted Instagram-face, much to our delight. Think chic, expensive-looking skin that requires much less upkeep and won't slip and slide, especially now that we’re shielding behind face masks half the time. Rest assured, the new crop of modern powders such as Pat McGrath Labs Sublime Perfection Powder, are so finely-milled, they’re barely perceptible on bare skin. On mature complexions, Pat prefers to press in a sheer layer on the forehead, sides of nose and chin to set makeup without accentuating any fine lines as the powder melts in and becomes one with the skin. If you’re blessed with an oilier skin type, powder can be an ally for healthy radiance. “Oily skin is so underestimated because you already have the advantage of a natural glow,” said Pat, who recommends using that as a starting point and balancing the shine with ‘intentional powder setting’. Instead of dusting the powder all over, as we are prone to do, use a smaller fluffy brush to apply the lightest amount only on areas prone to excess oil for a velvety, skin-like finish. When disguising pigmentation, scarring or discolouration, it’s tempting to reach for a full-coverage foundation, apply it all over and hope for the best. But if you’re after a ‘my-skin-but-better’ effect, it’s worth being mindful about application. Our skin is constantly changing, and chances are there are only certain areas that need any coverage. “Think about the desired result and focus on the details of your skin,” advised Pat. “You want it to look perfected but real, so start with the minimum amount of product first and determine what more needs to be done.”Pat starts by buffing in a small amount of the Skin Fetish Sublime Perfection Foundation, before strategically concealing using a detailed brush or fingers, targeting only the necessary areas. “When you’re intentional about customising coverage, skin is undetectably done and effortlessly finished,” she said. According to Pat, a minimalistic approach to highlighting guarantees a fresh, lustrous finish and the best formulas to achieve this are creams and balms with a clean gleam rather than chunky glitters. One of her brand’s earliest launch is the Skin Fetish: Highlighter + Balm Duo. “The balm drenches skin in hydration, creating the illusion of radiance that comes from within while minimising texture,” she explained. It’s a great option for everyone, but is especially forgiving on drier complexions. A post shared by Pat McGrath (@patmcgrathreal)Using your ring finger, simply tap on the balm on cheekbones, slope of the nose and Cupid’s bow for instant luminosity.

56,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-get-clear-skin,"Many people find it difficult to get clear skin. The methods for getting clear skin will vary, depending on the person’s skin type. In general, people struggling with acne or blemishes have skin that is dry, oily, or a combination of the two. Numerous skin care tips exist for different skin types, and there are also general tips that people can try. Anyone uncertain about their skin care routine should consult a dermatologist for additional advice.Keep reading to learn more.People may wish to try these general tips for getting clear skin fast.A pimple indicates trapped oil, sebum, and bacteria. It is also a sign that the body’s natural healing mechanism is working.Popping the pimple disrupts this healing process. Additionally, the released liquids expose the surrounding skin to similar bacteria, increasing the risk of additional pimples forming. The exposed pimple may also lead to permanent scarring. Whenever possible, avoid popping pimples. If they drain, keep the area clean.The American Academy of Dermatology recommend that people wash twice daily and then again after sweating. Leaving sweat on the skin and allowing it to dry can make acne worse, so it is best to wash the skin as soon as possible after sweating.Touching the face with the hands can deposit dirt, oils, and bacteria onto the skin and lead to breakouts. All skin types can benefit from moisturizing after a daily face wash. Keeping the face moisturized may help control sebum production and prevent damage from the outside elements. The most effective moisturizer will vary in each case, depending on the person’s skin type. Anyone uncertain of what moisturizers will work for them should contact a dermatologist.The sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays damage the skin. Wearing sunscreen whenever outdoors can help protect the skin from these harmful rays. People who need extra care for their skin will generally find that they react better to gentle products, which are less likely to irritate the skin. Products that commonly irritate sensitive skin include:Gentle, hypoallergenic versions of these products do exist. However, it is still important to test a small area of skin for reactions before applying any product to a more extensive area.Showering, bathing, or washing the hands and face with very hot water can dry out or damage the skin. People who notice dry skin after bathing can try using lukewarm water instead.Exfoliation is important to help wash away dead skin cells, but some devices can be too abrasive and may actually harm the skin. Tools such as washcloths, rough sponges, or loofahs may be too rough for the skin, causing damage and irritation.Some delicate options exist, such as soft cleansing brushes. Alternatively, using clean fingers to massage a cleanser into the face may help prevent extra irritation.Topical medications may help people of all skin types control acne. Several different medicated products are available, including:All cells in the body need water. The skin cells are closest to the environment and, therefore, may be more at risk of losing their moisture to the elements. Drinking water throughout the day may help keep the skin cells healthy.Eating a healthful diet rich in nutrients is important for the body as a whole, and it may also benefit the skin. Eating a diet rich in various plant foods and lean protein sources may help provide the nutrients that the skin needs to stay healthy.People looking to keep their skin clear may also want to cut out specific troublesome foods, such as dairy milk. A review in Clinical Nutrition found a positive relationship between milk and acne. Some believe that this link is due to the growth compounds and hormones that the milk contains. However, everyone may have different trigger foods that make their symptoms worse.Learn more about which foods can boost skin health here. While gentle, natural products can help manage the skin and may help with minor breakouts, people with persistent or severe acne should see a dermatologist to discuss medicated options. Medicated options will vary depending on skin type and acne severity.Sometimes, makeup products can aggravate breakouts. Switching to natural makeup products or those designed to let the pores breathe may help reduce breakouts from makeup.It is also important to remove all makeup each night and clean any makeup brushes or tools regularly.Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, some lifestyle changes may also help keep the skin balanced. Lifestyle changes to consider include:It is also important to minimize stress whenever possible. The authors of a 2017 article noted that acne vulgaris is one of the most common inflammatory skin disorders. They also highlight the link between stress and acne, stating that stress can increase inflammatory compounds in the body. Strong feelings of anger or emotional stress may lead to an acne breakout or make symptoms worse.Due to this, it is important to find ways of reducing stress to help control acne. Stress management techniques include:Stress-reducing activities will also vary from person to person. Some people may enjoy going for a walk in the woods while others might prefer writing in a journal, for example. Learn more about some stress-reducing activities here. People with oily skin may be more prone to acne and breakouts. Oily skin creates too much sebum and may have a shiny look to it. Some general tips for oily skin include:People with oily skin can look for a natural, oil-free cleanser that helps break down and wash away excess sebum without adding even more oil to the skin. A number of mild cleansers are available specifically for acne-prone skin.People with oily skin may also have an oily scalp. This excess oil can move to the face and encourage breakouts. Washing the hair each day may help control oil and reduce breakouts.People with oily skin who are prone to acne may benefit from using a gentle toner to help unclog the pores. Products containing ingredients such as salicylic acid or glycolic acid may help balance the skin’s pH and keep the pores clear.Oily skin may also be more reactive to sunlight. Wearing sunscreen during any exposure to sunlight may help reduce this reaction. However, it is important to find sunscreens without oil or other ingredients that will contribute to more clogged pores.Learn more about remedies and tips for oily skin here. People with combination skin have to care for dry patches of skin in addition to more oily areas, such as the T-zone, which is an oily zone that runs above the eyebrows and down the nose to the chin, making a T shape.Facial cleansing can be tricky for people with combination skin. While some may respond well to a facial cleanser designed for oily skin, others may find that this dries out some patches of skin too much. People with troublesome combination skin may find that using a general mild cleanser on the face and then an oil-reducing cleanser on any oily areas helps balance the skin. Using blotting papers for oily spots may help temporarily balance combination skin and make it easier to manage. It may also help prevent sebum overproduction leading to acne breakouts in these areas.Dry skin produces less oil naturally, which can reduce the skin’s vitality.People with dry skin may still struggle with acne, which may appear if they use an unsuitable moisturizer or add too much oil to their face to counteract their skin’s natural state.The following are some tips on caring for dry skin:Moisture is essential for dry skin, but it is important to find a source of moisture that does not clog the pores. Some people may find that their skin responds well to natural oils, such as argan oil, olive oil, or coconut oil.Finding a gentle wash that does not strip the skin of natural oils is especially important for people with dry skin. It may be best for an individual to work with a dermatologist to find the best gentle cleanser for their skin.People can try a variety of techniques for attaining clear skin at home.The best methods will depend on the person’s skin type.However, general lifestyle changes, such as reducing stress, staying hydrated, and eating a healthful diet, can be effective for many people.

COVID-19,             coronavirus,             Leadership,             Fda,             event

The Coronavirus as an illness as well as the precautions and preparations that individuals, institutions, and governments worldwide are taking to deal with the threats and realities of this new virus are affecting every industry in manifold ways.Of course, the beauty industry is affected drastically too. To put this into perspective within the US, for example, the personal care industry contributes over $235bn to the GDP and employs some 3.6m people (according to data shared online by the Personal Care Products Council​).Here, to start understanding the response and results of the pandemic, is a look at how the cosmetics, personal care, and fragrance industries are faring under the circumstances.Handwashing along with the science of soap and surfactants have been front and center since the Coronavirus outbreak began. In fact, after “avoiding exposure,” ​handwashing is the CDC’s top recommendation for people to protect themselves from COVID-19​. It’s a reality that reinforces the importance and reach of the personal care industry.And beauty makers like Avon are donating soap to help countries around the world limit the spread of COVID-19. This Forbes Romania article details the social-selling company’s donation of 1.7 tons of soap to quarantine centers​ in that country.Hand sanitizer is the next best option to protect against illness and the spread of Coronavirus for many of the same reasons that make personal care products trendy in conventional circumstances: it’s effective, portable, and doesn’t require water to use.EO Products made news this week​ when the company announced it’s upping production of its hand sanitizer, manufacturing 4 times more than usual and with no plans to change the price.LVMH has begun repurposing its fragrance making facilities (which usually produce scents for Dior, Givenchy, and Guerlain) to manufacture sanitizer for “French authorities” ​and “the largest hospital system in Europe,” ​as Forbes reports​.And Firmenich is set to start making disinfectant solution, some 20 tons of it, for donation to the Geneva University Hospital and other responders. “As a responsible Swiss company, we must take action and lead by example, to help our local community during these exceptionally challenging times,”​ comments Gilbert Ghostine, CEO, Firmenich, in a LinkedIn update the company posted online Monday.While Cosmetics Design doesn’t often cover home care, industrial, or professional personal care news, it’s worth mentioning that companies like P&G that make consumer goods also manufacture professional product as well. That company has suggested disinfection protocols on their pro site​ for businesses and public institutions to follow in an effort to keep employees and customers safe.And coincidentally, P&G also just launched a new disinfectant brand. Microban 24 was developed to kill cold and flu viruses, as Barrett J. Brunsman of the Cincinnati Business Courier reports​; and while the new product line is tested and proven to kill some strains of Coronavirus, testing protocols don’t yet exist for COVID-19. So at this time, no claims are being made suggesting that it kills the COVID-19 virus.And, speaking of claims, the FDA and FTC have been swift to respond to products and marketers boasting unfounded treatment or prevention COVID-19 claims.Early last week, the FDA sent letters to 7 companies for “the sale and promotion of fraudulent COVID-19 products [which the Agency considers] to be a threat to the public health.” ​Letters were sent to Vital Silver, Quinessence Aromatherapy Ltd., Xephyr, LLC doing business as N-Ergetics, GuruNanda LLC, Vivify Holistic Clinic, Herbal Amy LLC, and The Jim Bakker Show. More information can be found here on the FDA site​.In more promising news, personal care and medical multinationals like Johnson & Johnson are already at work developing a vaccine for this particular strain of the Coronavirus. As the publication Drug Discovery Trends​ reports, J&J’s Jansen Pharmaceuticals has partnered with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on vaccine development.And Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotech venture that’s made headlines here on ComseticsDesign.com for its work in fragrance ingredient innovation, is now ready to share its technology platform and facilities with experts working to develop and scale inputs needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. “To support the people building the treatments that will stop COVID-19 Ginkgo is now offering…[use of the company’s] platform to accelerate development of point of care diagnostics, vaccines, or therapeutics,” ​according to a statement on the company’s site​.In the past few weeks, trade show postponements and cancellations have become expensive everyday occurrences. Expo West 2020, the natural products tradeshow expecting some 3,500+ exhibitors and over 86,000 attendees was canceled. ​Cosmoprof Bolognia has been rescheduled​ twice, and is currently on the calendar for September 3 – 7.in-cosmetics global, set to take place this year in Barcelona, Spain, has been pushed back to June.​ And companion events like The Future of Clean, hosted by biotech ingredient maker Aprinova, have been rescheduled to coincide with the new tradeshow dates.The Indie Beauty Media Group was notably lagging in its response to the virus and only just canceled its IBE and Uplink Live Berlin events (originally set for March 25 and 26) late last week. At that same time, IBE Dallas, and the BeautyX Summit event that runs the same week, were postponed until June 10 and 11.The 2020 NYSCC Suppliers Day event has been postponed​; and just today that organization was able to confirm new dates with the Javits Convention Center in New York City, and announced that the beauty ingredient tradeshow will take place on September 30 – October 1. LuxePack New York announced new dates this week. The packaging tradeshow that serves not only beauty but also the luxury confectionery and liquor industries will now take place July 8 and 9.Unfiltered Experience, a show launched just last year that connects influencers and brands in real time, has adjusted its 2020 event calendar for events running in Chicago, Illinois; Nashville, Tennessee; and Los Angeles, California. Find out more here at Unfiltered Experience.com.  ​ Fragrance Day is this Saturday! (March 21).  But like so many industry event organizers, The Fragrance Foundation has adjusted its event program and is encouraging fragrance brands, consumers who love scent, and industry allies to be involved and engage with @fragrancefoundation online using the hashtag #FragranceDay.  The CBD Global Summit​ (produced by WRBM, the company that publishes CosmeticsDesign.com) has also been postponed.Virtual events are replacing live events when possible; and some industry allies like the Base Beauty Creative Agency are even actively reaching out to new and exisiting clients to help keep everyone connected​ during this time of self-quarantines, lockdowns, and social distancing.  The CEW is keeping up with webinars but has announced postponement of all March, April, and May in-person events. Check that professional organization’s website for the latest updates.​Plenty of jobs these days are computer intensive and remote working is the best option in the current situation. For instance Unilever has made it clear that “All office-based employees globally should work from home,” ​as of Friday​.But even before most national and local governments instituted travel bans, many companies and brands in the beauty industry set limitations and guidelines on travel in an effort to keep everyone safe. And ingredient suppliers and manufacturers such as L’Oreal​ have made news with travel restrictions.Of course, entire countries from Italy to Spain to France and beyond have stopped or limited international travel in an effort to combat the spread and devastation of COVID-19. Here in the Americas region, the Canadian government has recommended self-isolation for anyone visiting from outside the country​.This is not yet an option for Mexico. Reportedly, economic conditions in that country have meant that Mexico’s response is limited​ for now.Beauty tourism and travel businesses are impacted as well. Around The World Beauty​ has made cancellations and adjustments to its 2020 schedule. And like many entrepreneurs and self-employed professionals are doing just now, ATWB  Founder Stephanie Flor is looking for creative ways to not only keep business afloat but also to keep consumers connected and engaged. Flor is at work just now on a four-part documentary series and is currently crowdfunding donations to advance the Around The  World Beauty film project​. Hers is one of many initiatives right now that is supporting entrepreneurs, self-employed, and gig workers during this trying time. Nearly a full month ago, cosmetics and personal care manufacturers were already reporting supply chain disruptions. And, COVID-19-related supply interruptions continue to show up as illness and precautions to prevent further spread of the virus impact the global workforce.At a conference in February, P&G CFO Joh Moeller remarked that as many as 17,600 products could be affected, as Andrew Allen of Supply Management News reported​.With new challenges, come new opportunities. And new industry events are coming online quickly—events that are meant to help corporate leaders and business owners from across the cosmetics and personal care industry survive (if not thrive) during the Coronavirus disruption.Women’s Wear Daily is running a short series of webinars, starting Wednesday, dedicated to Crisis Management and the Coronavirus. ​  Next week, The Glow Getter Collective is running an online event called The Breakthrough Brands Summit​ for D2C brand leaders looking to help their brand stand out and thrive in the current marketplace.And it’s worth nothing that Salon Today is putting on a webinar this Wednesday for salon professionals that’s all about Preparing Your Business to Weather the COVID-19 Crisis​.Independent beauty brands are facing truly unprecedented challenges and the Indie Beauty Media Group is working as hard as the next entrepreneur-led team to keep this key segment of the industry informed and connected as best as possible.To that end, the IBMG’s own news site Beauty Independent published an interview this week with IBMG founders Jillian Wright and Nader Naeymi-Rad​.Lab work and clinical testing is slowing down and, in some cases, stopping—temporarily—to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.A LinkedIn post from Dr Theresa Callaghan of Callaghan Consulting International​ earlier this week, asked about any protocol or industry-wide response in the clinical and consumer testing sector. And based on the response so far, it seems that individual labs are making the call on whether testing will continue.Numerous beauty makers, ingredient suppliers, and allies all along the value chain are taking measures they hoped to never have to take.Hugh Welsh, General Counsel, Secretary, and President at DSM North America shared news of the specialty chemical company’s move to Stage Orange protocol in the US this week. The Stage Orange measures send employees that can work from home, home. And while the company is not closing operations in this country, Welsh is interested in sharing notes and refining best practices with the help of other industry executives (see the ‘It’s wise to share resources and best practices at times like this’ section below for more details).Some ingredient makers are promising business as usual, despite logistical changes and preparedness measures being taken behind the scenes. Natural ingredient supplier Alban Muller posted such a statement on LinkedIn​ earlier this week.And IFF posted a similarly reassuring message​ online: “IFF is modifying the ways we work and communicate to best position the organization to deliver the leading solutions that you have come to expect….As such, we have instituted a number of policies across the organization to protect the health and safety of our team, while minimizing the risk of disruption to our business,”​ wrote that company’s CEO and Chairman Andreas Fibig.In the age of authenticity, some brand leaders are speaking out quite openly and sharing their personal and political take on how the pandemic is being handled. In a recent social media post​, Charles Denton, CEO and Chairman of Erno Laszlo New York, called “The UK Government’s response to COVID-19…wholly wrong and criminal.”​For retailers and salons and spas, the COVID-19 pandemic is a very real disruption. Even before large-scale quarantines and shutdowns, some retailers like Glossier closed their doors​.For now, D2C brands seem to have the advantage with online storefronts and shipping directly to consumers. And some, like trèStiQue, have services built in to their business that make shopping for makeup during a pandemic even simpler. trèStiQue offers selfie shade matching (done by humans, not algorithms) and sanitary sampling with their 30-day free trial program​. Shoppers choose full-size products and have 30 days to use the trèStiQue makeup at home before either deciding to buy or return the products. It’s a strategy that’s not only good for shoppers; the brand tells Cosmetics Design that 70-80% of try-before-you-buy customers opt to purchase the collection—a very good conversation rate as makeup brands look for ways to keep business moving during this time.  Stella Rising, a marketing and digital media agency, is keeping in touch with its focus group community—Glimmer—about the Coronavirus and posted this blog outlining beauty consumer concerns and behavior​ late last week.And, salon owners and professionals may find this item, by Anne Moratto of Salon Today​ on the likely impact of the virus, helpful. In the LinkedIn post he made late last week, Hugh Welsh of DSM made it clear that specialty chemical companies and other ingredient makers are in this together.“I am happy to share our full guidance with whomever is interested,” ​wrote Welsh, adding that “I am really interested in how other companies are addressing some of the unprecedented challenges businesses are facing with schools closing, potentially large groups of ill/ quarantined employees, extended tele working…” ​And he “would welcome the chance to collaborate with HR, Ops, legal, comms in other organizations as we are all confronting the same issues.” ​Find his post (open for comments) online here.​ICMAD has created a questionnaire “to gather and consolidate examples of interruptions for the purpose of later describing the impact of [the COVID-19 pandemic] on our industry; especially small business.” ​Find that brief 3-question survey here.​And read even more beauty industry news regarding COVID-19 by following these links:Estée Lauder plots path to recovery from COVID-19 outbreak​How the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the APAC personal care industry​COVID-19 presents an opportunity to reconsider supply chain strategy​Luxasia implements measures to safeguard jobs amid COVID-19 crisis​LVMH producing hydroalcoholic gel for France amid COVID-19​---Deanna Utroske is a leading voice in the cosmetics and personal care industry​ as well as in the indie beauty movement.

Free subscriber-exclusive audiobook!“No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention”Get it now on Libro.fm using the button below.Though Jennifer Lopez is known for her singing, dancing, and acting, she's also become a beauty icon because of her flawless skin.The 51-year-old has been talking about her skin routine for years, but now she's launching her own product line, JLo Beauty. The star announced her line on Thursday with an Instagram video that gives followers a look into the creation process. It shows Lopez testing products with developers, explaining her mom's love of olive oil as a beauty cure-all, and choosing to use natural oils over synthetic oils in her creams.

Followers took to the comments section of the announcement video to accuse Lopez of hiding another part of her own regimen: Botox and fillers. ""That's interesting, she gets all types of professional skin treatments and wants people to think simple topical products will make a difference,"" one commenter said. ""I hope so but it's a stretch.""Another simply claimed, ""Botox galore!"" while others acknowledged her good genes, but remained skeptical of her limited facial creases: ""good gene ok, but no little lines on the face is impossible.""But the singer denies having gotten any work done on her face.Lopez replied to some of the comments, saying ""I have never done Botox. These are my real skincare secrets ..."" and ""sorry baby no I haven't ever used [Botox and fillers]. This is what I use I hope you enjoy. Also a joyful heart helps.""

One supportive follower wrote, ""lol right. Women can't handle the fact that some just have good genes. My mom is almost 60 and looks 35.""  Others chimed in to point out that Lopez also credits exercise, diet, and hydration for her skin: ""Also she said you need to look after yourself be kind to your self. I'm nearly 40 and try and stay away from stress I'm not old looking — or weathered — just lucky.""

The singer told InStyle in 2018 that she's ""a firm believer in SPF"" and that her No. 1 beauty tip is to get plenty of sleep — ideally nine or 10 hours. She also told People in 2016 that she uses ""glycolic acid to get that healthy glow and 
                          
clear skin
,"" and that she never goes to bed without taking off her makeup from the day.She also revealed to the magazine that night creams, along with plenty of water, keep her skin hydrated. ""Sorry, it's true!"" she told People. ""I think drinking lots of water and fresh foods with lots of fruits and vegetables (I keep [them] with me at all times) all play into the quality of skin's appearance."" In fact, Lopez recently revealed that she specifically rejected Botox when she was in her 20s and never looked back.The star recently told Elle magazine that a dermatologist had recommended Botox to her when she was 23 years old and she turned it down. She said if she had done it, ""My face would be a totally different face today.""Lopez's skin-care line, which is set to drop on December 8, offers a serum, moisturizer, mask, different creams, a cleanser, and a complexion booster.",7.12,10,6.2,9.03,3.25,622

I have my eyebrows and lips tinted with a semi-permanent tint that lasts 12 months with just one annual top-up. It was the best investment I ever made as it means I always have colour in my brows and lips - something that fades with age - so even the days I am makeup free I still have definition and colour. Eyebrows frame your face and when defined make you look more youthful.

Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people that doesn’t suit makeup - I really believe I look better with makeup on. I have friends and family members - my mum - who are beautiful without it, they really don’t need it. I definitely look better with my 'face on’. Like my style, I change my look depending on my mood, what I’m doing, where I’m going. The smoky eye is probably my best beauty look as it defines your eyes. I don’t like lots of foundation but I like good coverage that I can highlight with bronzer and blusher.Describe your golden rules for gorgeous hair?
It’s very simple really. Use good quality products like the Hair Biology range from Pantene - the range also includes a mask - I do all the things I do with my skincare routine to my hair. The Hair Biology range has a lot of the ingredients I have in my face cleanser and moisturiser. I also treat my hair from time to time with a mask. Try not to style your hair too often with heated appliances as they will damage your hair. Try not to blow dry your hair every day and when you do, reduce the amount of time it takes to blow dry your hair if you can.We need your consent to load this Instagram contentWe use Instagram to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

It’s liberating to see more truth on social media especially Instagram where influencers are showing the ‘real person’ before as well as after makeup, hair, etc. I like the way it allows me to show’ the real me’ unlike TV - it’s less polished and rehearsed. I think Roz Purcell was the champion of her generation in being real. I admire her truth and honesty.

A lot of what I do is in the public eye and therefore having to look ‘presentable’ is part of that. I know I am their role model so outside of work I make sure there is not too much emphasis on the importance of how you look.

  So the big day is over and the lack of sleep and indulgence of rich food and alcohol has left you feeling less than human, I am sure you wont be the only one. I thought it would be beneficial to talk about ways to make you feel better, and to help repair some damage.

  Excess Sugar, alcohol and rich foods can make us feel tired and sluggish the next day, our skin can look dull and dehydrated. I know I have advised avoiding these things to keep a healthy skin and body, but it is ok every now and again to let your hair down and enjoy, especially at Christmas time.

  I think the key is to keep hydrated throughout the day, so try and drink plenty of water in between alcoholic or sugary drinks, that way you won’t feel the after effects as severely.

  Lack of sleep over the Christmas period for some can leave you reaching for sugary foods and can leave us feeling exhausted, so post-Christmas party, try and get some extra sleep, you skin will love you for it and you will feel so much better. 

  Lack of sleep can discourage you to have the motivation to exercise, so even if you go for a nice walk, it will boost your circulation and lift your mood and help your skin to get its glow back. 

  Getting the family out in the fresh air will do you all good, or if you are on your own a peaceful walk can be a nice too. Exercise can be great for your mental health, and it will get teens off their devices and have a little family time.

How to look and feel human again

Top Tips

I would like to wish you all a very merry, safe, and heathy Christmas and a healthy, happy peaceful new year!

62,https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/advice-from-older-women,"From putting toothpaste on a zit to snoozing with a face full of foundation and thinking a placid expression would keep us young, we’ve all done good and bad things to our skin, thinking it didn’t matter in the long run.Well, the long run is here! Below, women in their 50s and older share their skin and beauty wisdom.“I’m a trained aesthetician. My advice has always been to never go to bed with makeup on, otherwise your pores will be clogged and your face will look dirty and puffy when you wake up. Learned that the hard way!” — Darlene Tenes, 55Verified: Cleansing off the day’s makeup and pollution can reduce irritation, which can age or irritate your skin. One case study last year found that 25 years of inadequate mascara removal can lead to major irritation.“Everyone always tells me that I look young for my age. I think it’s just because I’m always smiling and laughing. The happier you appear, the younger you look! I wasted too many years in my life not smiling.” — Ann Wolinsky, 64Verified: There’s no need to shy away from crow’s feet! Wrinkles are known to show our overall disposition, and if the crinkles appear because of our smiles, then a permanent marker of our happiness is all the better.“Skin care products don’t have to be fancy or pricey! I make my own face washes and lotions using essential oils and other natural, plant-based products. For instance, I made my daily moisturizer by combining organic, unrefined coconut oil and lavender essential oil.” — Jill Lebofsky, 49Verified: A skin care routine that’s out of your budget isn’t a routine for you. Likewise, everyone has a different approach and tolerance to popular ingredients.Evidence around coconut oil for skin is mixed, as coconut oil is comedogenic — meaning it can clog pores and cause acne, blackheads, or whiteheads. When it’s mixed with lavender essential oil, it may be able to help fight inflammation and wounds as well. Experiment with your routine, but always remember to patch test.“I do an armpit detox at least once a year to […] stop the stink. I find this increases the efficacy of natural deodorants so I don’t have to use more toxic deodorants. Who wouldn’t want their deodorant to be more effective?” — LebofskyVerified: Armpit detoxes may be able to help with smells and deodorant buildup, but if you’re looking for a surefire answer about efficacy, there’s none at the moment. However, we find the matter of sweat to be a personal matter — when it comes to feeling the pits, a mask might be just want you need.“Never wash your face with bar of generic soap! It’ll dry your skin out. For example, I only use a more delicate facial foaming cleanser before I shower which I then rinse off under the shower water.” — Patricia Cole, 76Verified: When soaps aren’t formulated for the face, it can mess up your pH balance and dry it out. There are many other ways to wash your face, from oil cleansers to sonic brushes. Check out the 15 do’s and don’ts for washing your face.“The most obvious advice is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, but I’ve found that there’s one product that minimizes the effects of sun damage: vitamin C serum. My favorite product is the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic serum, which I apply a few drops of every morning. I’m actually 60 and no one believes me when I tell them!” — Silvia Tobler, 60Verified: Vitamin C is one of the best hydrating, brightening, and firming antioxidant ingredients for your skin. Combined with vitamin E and ferulic acid — which help stabilize the product — it’s a win-win for your healthiest skin.“I wish I thought about my hands and all the possible sun exposure and damage that can happen while driving! I would have been more diligent with sunscreen on the hands or driving with gloves.” — Margina Dennis, 51Verified: On top of hands, the earlobes, neck, chest, and eyelids are other areas many people forget to sunscreen.“Those products may be a little pricier but can have therapeutic benefits while moisturizing, reducing fine lines, [and reducing skin irritations and inflammation, including mature skin acne]. Two products I especially I love are Clean Coconut’s CBD lotions and No Borders Natural’s moisturizer. It’s worth trying.” — Aliza Sherman, 53Verified: CBD is an up and coming contender in the beauty space, with its moisturizing and anti-inflammation properties — though you should check if it’s available in your area. People with dry skin may find it especially helpful. But it’s far from the best and shouldn’t replace tried-and-true ingredients like retinol.“My biggest tip is to stay out of the sun or, when you are in the sun, wear good sunscreen. I am 55 years old and have sun spots from sun exposure. Many of my friends and I have excessive or early wrinkles from the sun. We used to lay out in the sun slathered with baby oil! I wish instead of focusing on how tan I was I had just used sunblock all year round.” — Maria Leonard Olsen, 55Verified: UV rays are a number one contributor to photoaging and skin damage. Protecting yourself with sunscreen daily is one easy way of preventing surprise skin changes, such as wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, spots, damage, and burning.“When I was younger I used to lay in the sun with my hair covered in Sun-In and lemon juice. But that’ll only dry out your hair and cause breakage! I wish I had started going to a professional hairstylist to color my hair earlier.” — Patty Bell, 58Verified: Whether you’re DIY-ing rainbow hair or looking to cover up small grays, it’s worth consulting a professional. Hair treatments can vary depending on your texture, thickness, and overall hair health, whether it’s been treated with chemicals or not. Speaking to a professional about the right treatment can end up saving you money in the long-run.“Don’t smoke. Ever. Quit! It’s so bad for your skin and teeth.” — BellVerified: The substances in cigarettes cause your skin to dry out, which leads to premature aging. And it can cause your teeth to yellow, which can make you look older.“I wish I had known the impact diet would have on my future health and aging. I always say, ‘If I had known in my 20s what I learned in my 40s, I would look like I was 10 today.’ I wish I had started eating more raw food soon. I truly think adding more raw foods to my diet has given me an edge, more energy, and reduce overall inflammation. Plus, it helps me maintain a healthy weight.” — Carol Alt, 58Verified: A raw diet is focused in fruits and vegetables, which science has shown to help with heart health, weight maintenance, and digestion. It never hurts to eat more raw vegetables and whole foods if you’re not already, but don’t go too far in one direction. A raw vegan diet increases your risk for being nutritionally unbalanced.“I am a breast cancer survivor as well as a September 11th widow. I have been through trauma in my life, but I live my life healthfully and peacefully and I am always told how young I look for my age. I think the reason is that I use skin care with clean ingredients, which help add brightness and clarity to my complexion.” — Meryl Marshall, 60Verified: Clean beauty is a buzzword that’s making rounds in the industry, but what does it mean? It basically comes down to being “non-toxic” and often “all-natural.” For many, it’s a safe indicator that a product won’t irritate their skin. However, these terms aren’t regulated by the FDA, so it’s important to do your research before adding a product to your shopping cart.“I aim to drink a gallon of water each day. It plumps up my skin and gives me more energy.” — Tracee Gluhaich, 53Verified: Drinking enough water is one of the best ways to get your body running optimally. It can help relieve constipation and get waste out of your body faster, prevent dehydrated skin to help maintain your glow, and more.“Acupuncture has helped greatly with my skin overall. I’ve noticed the texture and quality of my skin has improved, and the tiny lines have begun to soften quite noticeably. The best way to explain it is that I feel like my skin has gone back 10 years. It’s more plump, clearer and I feel fresher and more awake. I definitely recommend facial acupuncture. I wish that I had found it as soon as my skin started to show its age”. — Lisa A, 50Verified: Facial acupuncture is reported to brighten up complexion, stimulate collagen, reduce jaw tension, and soften overall appearance. While there’s not enough research to fully conclude these benefits, the science looks promising.“Moisturize your neck now, so that you don’t have to be afraid about covering it all up later. In my opinion, one of the loveliest parts of a woman’s body as she ages is the “portrait” area — from the top of the bust to the chin.Think about Renaissance paintings, you can always see this area. But as women get older, they cover this area up! If you carry your skin care routine below the neck you’ll have more confidence to rock an off-shoulder, sweetheart, or V neckline when you get older.” — Andrea Pflaumer, 71Verified: Skin health doesn’t stop at the face! As mentioned above, the neck and chest area are two places people often forget to sunscreen.“I’m a firm believer in being the best we can be at the age we are. As a breast cancer survivor who went through five surgeries as well as multiple rounds of chemo and radiation, I [believe] in not having to take drastic measures so that you can feel as good on the outside as you feel on the inside at any age. Because the cancer meds caused me to dry up, I encountered all sorts of issues after treatment, including skin-related challenges.My biggest piece of advice to younger women is to start thinking about noninvasive, nonsurgical technologies… probably way before you would normally start to think about it. We’re so fortunate to live in an age where women have access to wonderful technological options!” — Meryl Kern, 62Verified: While you might not be ready for lasers or injections, knowing exactly what goes into noninvasive procedures — instead of finding out about them too late — is a critical step to feeling confident about achieving your ideal skin. For example, being against Botox is easy in your 20s but your skin changes sometimes exponentially in your 30s and 40s. Knowing the facts around Botox may change your perspective and provide a less challenging journey as a result. If after you know the facts, you discover you still don’t want Botox, lasering, or chemical peels, realizing that there’s nothing else to be done can provide a world of relief and confidence in yourself, too.Gabrielle Kassel is a rugby-playing, mud-running, protein-smoothie-blending, meal-prepping, CrossFitting, New York–based wellness writer.

			From how to look glowing on a video conference call to her DIY blow dry trick. Loved for her no-nonsense product recommendations on Instagram, and for her hugely popular makeup brand, Trinny London, it's fair to say that Trinny Woodall has established herself as on official beauty guru. While beauty may not feel like a priority right now, we firmly believe that taking time out to focus on yourself and feeling your best can be an important part of self-care – and it seems that Trinny agrees with us. So, whether you have been struggling with your beauty routine since lockdown led to salon closures, or simply find yourself with a little extra time to try out something new with your skin, makeup and hair regimes, we caught up with Trinny to discover more about her at-home beauty tips.From how to look glowing on a video conference call to her DIY blow dry tips, read on for Trinny's words of wisdom... A post shared by T R I N N Y (@trinnywoodall)""Well, I've got meetings all day, which means I am on a computer a lot of the time, so I always have my Trinny London BFF Cream on, because I want my skin to be a bit glowy. ""And then, right now, I'm using my new Sheer Shimmer in Mama – it's an instant fix so if I'm really late to get on the computer and chat to people, I just put it on my lips on cheeks, and I look like I've been for a fantastic bit of exercise with a healthy glow.""On top of that, my lashes are falling out, so I'm beginning to use things to condition them, because I used to have eyelash extensions but nearly all of them have gone. I've been using castor oil on my lashes, as well as RevitaLash, and I also take biotin. ""In the day, I'm using Kevyn Aucoin mascara, or Talika Eyelash conditioning gel, and that's it; that's my basic everyday makeup routine. ""Then, through the day, because I'm doing lots of makeup videos for Trinny TV on my Instagram, I'll put a tonne of different looks on. But as the beginning of my day, that's always my start.""
TRINNY LONDONBUY NOWTRINNY LONDONBUY NOW ""It's no different from when we weren’t on lockdown really, because I've always had this kind of ritualistic approach to my skin. So, I will still double cleanse at night, and make sure I take all makeup off and then put a gel cleanser on top. Typically, I will use a balm for this, and one I love is from Botanics. They do a really competitively priced balm; it's so good and it compares to all those expensive balms from the likes of Sarah Chapman and Emma Hardie. ""Then I use the Julia Hunter Cleansing Gel on top, which is an American doctor's brand, and then I use vitamin C every day. I also use SPF because it's sunny at the moment and, whilst I might not be outside much because we don't have a very big garden, it's really important to use every day. I swear by our Trinny London BFF Cream, which includes SPF 30. ""I'm also trying out loads of different serums at the moment for filming. So, I go on a rotation, and I usually do one side of my face with one serum and the other side with another. Right now, I'm using Allies of Skin Vitamin C on one side and Garden of Wisdom C-Deep Vitamin C Serum on the other. I've got to say that they're both equally as good, and one is over £100 while the other is £18!"" ""One hundred per cent. One thing I think is a great idea is to make one day a week your  'dress up day', where you do a full set of makeup, and a really nice outfit. You can even say to anyone you live with, 'This is my dress up day, so I'm not lifting a finger in my own house today. Anyone else can but I can't hoover in this, I can't cook in this, I can't do anything in this. I just want to feel like a gorgeous woman today.' ""Otherwise, I don't believe it's a good idea to wake up and keep on your lounging-around clothing because I think, psychologically, it can be debilitating. So, I recommend making that little effort, getting dressed as if you're going outside but obviously not with the coat or shoes. Just paring it down a bit, but not being in your sweatpants or pyjamas all day.""A post shared by T R I N N Y (@trinnywoodall)""I'd say a great lip. You know, you're going to be communicating with the majority of people through a screen, and they’re not going to see much of your face. If you were wearing really natural makeup, you couldn't really tell, so I think a bright lip is just fabulous. It brings joy to those people viewing you on the screen as well as yourself.""""Absolutely, as I don't always have the time to try lots. I’m going back to really old favourites, like a No7 mask I use if my skin is feeling a bit dry and tired. I massage it into my skin and wipe off the residue. It gives skin a nice plumpness. And then I also do exfoliating masks because we need to slosh off those dead skin cells. So, any kind of gentle acid mask – maybe with glycolic acid in there – is key."" A post shared by T R I N N Y (@trinnywoodall)""Today, I did the roughest dry on my hair and it was really frizzy, so I've actually just used a skincare product on it to take out the frizz, because nothing else was working! I would love to not bother blow drying my hair, but I make so many bits of content per day and I just couldn't bear to look at my hair all frizzy and uncontrollable, so I make an effort with my hair once a week.""I do the DIY blow dry that my hairdresser taught me, which takes me literally 15 minutes, but gives me great hair. The secret is to use a small bristle brush, and don't curl the ends. I get this texture in my hair, which is just a really good look. That lasts for about three days, and then I might start putting my hair up occasionally.""""Coming out of winter and into spring is just about getting a bit of glow back in your skin. I use the Trinny London Golden Glow in Soala, which is a gel bronzer. It makes it seem like you might have been in the sun, which is a look I like.""""My all time favourite is the Julia Hunter cleanser because it offers just the perfect balance of cleansing. Others I like are the Evolve Melting Cleanser, which is a gel balm with a very good consistency. It's a good price and also organic. I'd also always reach for the De Mamiel cleanser when I'm having a treat because you smell these amazing aromatherapy oils and it just makes me feel emotionally lifted.  ""I never believe a moisturiser is going to give you tremendously active ingredients, because I think those usually come in a serum. If I do use moisturiser, its just because I want that sensorial feeling of putting it on my skin and that instant plumpness. I usually go for the Santa Maria Novella Crema F, which is an avocado-based cream, a bit like an old fashioned white cream. It penetrates beautifully and I love the smell.""And then a super-packed serum I like is by Emepelle. It's a product I've been trying for about five months. It's specifically targeted at women who are menopausal and have suddenly got that sagging, dry, dehydrated skin. It's a very good all-in-one serum. It's not cheap, but then you could literally discard nearly all of your other products.""""For makeup, it has to be my BFF Cream for every single day because of the SPF, and that glow it gives. ""Then, I also love the Trinny Londdon BFF Eye Serum Concealer, because I'm working long days right now, and it gives my eyes such a lift. It's like an eye cream and a serum had a baby together.""""Then, for eyeshadow, I use a pop of our Eye2Eye in Wisdom. It's a neutral shade, which works with everything. I’d say it's the best neutral eye shade ever.""

Decades after Marilyn Monroe shone in the Hollywood spotlight, her beauty lives on.And now, thanks to an artifact unearthed by New York City’s Makeup Museum, fans of the blond bombshell get a glimpse into how she stayed so gorgeous.A document revealing the iconic actress’ personalized beauty routine is on display as part of the museum’s “Pink Jungle: 1950s Makeup in America” digital exhibit. In the letter, dated March 17, 1959 and addressed to Mrs. Marilyn Monroe Miller (she was married to playwright Arthur Miller at the time), dermatologist Erno Laszlo wrote out detailed skin-care instructions for the then-32-year-old star.And upon studying the document, NYC dermatologist Julie Russak says it provides many clues about Monroe’s skin and that there’s much to be learned from her routine today. And many of the products she used are still available now.“Laszlo was really ahead of his time,” says Russak, who runs Russak Dermatology Clinic on East 57th Street. “His regimen talks about taking care of the lips, the neck and décolletage — not just the face.”“He personalized every prescription for all of his clients, and Marilyn Monroe was on the drier side,” says Patricia Schuffenhauer, Erno Laszlo’s chief historian and branding officer, in a video posted by the West Village museum. So, all the products in her routine “were to help hydrate her skin.”In the mornings, Monroe was told to wash her face and neck in warm water with Phelityl Cleansing Bar ($38 at ErnoLaszlo.com) before applying “well-shaken” Normalizer Shake-It treatment ($49, and also reportedly beloved by Greta Garbo) on her face, avoiding the eye area, and then immediately blotting it off.Beneath her eyes, she was instructed to apply eye cream “in tiny dots, spreading it gently over the surface,” and then blotting it off as well. For the final step, she was meant to apply a powder to her entire face and neck — and then brush it off with cotton after one minute.In the evenings, Monroe was directed to apply Phelityl Pre-Cleansing Oil ($58) with a cotton pad, cleanse using water plus the same soap from the morning routine, blot it dry and apply Active Phelityl Intensive Cream over it ($88) and blot off the excess with a cleansing lotion before re-applying the cream. Phew.If that sounds like a lot of blotting, it is, but Russak says Monroe’s process — skipping any harsh rubbing and scrubbing and then reapplying moisturizer — helps reinforce the skin’s moisture barrier.A key part of Monroe’s prescription, listed at the bottom of the letter, is a list of foods to avoid — “any kind of nuts, chocolate, olives, oysters and clams.” Turns out, it’s not diamonds, but diets that are a girl’s best friend.Corbis via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesView Slideshow“When the skin is dry and you lose a lot of moisture, it’s prone to being more inflamed,” says Russak, so such restrictions were likely mandated to fight inflammation. “What we eat and what our body absorbs does show up on our skin.”For one, many of the foods that Laszlo told Monroe to skip are high in salt. “Salt is not something you want to increase in your diet, because it makes you retain water, so your skin looks blotchy and swollen,” Russak adds. Those cured olives served atop the ubiquitous martinis of Monroe’s era? Sayonara.Russak also flags that peanuts — which Monroe might’ve encountered served up as salty bar snacks at a cocktail lounge — can be particularly problematic. “When peanuts are exposed to too much moisture, they can grow aflatoxin, which is toxic,” she says. “It can affect your liver, and in smaller doses, can create inflammation in the body. And that then translates to the skin.”Skipping chocolate isn’t a bad idea, either, says the derm.“Chocolate can be good for you, but only if it’s about 80% dark. Anything below has a lot of fat and calories, and won’t give you anti-oxidants and polyphenols,” she says. “Anything below that percentage really has no dietary value, and it has added sugar, dairy and fat. Most of the time it’s easier just to avoid chocolate in general, because it’s going to come out as breakouts on the skin.”Shellfish poses a slightly different risk.“Oysters and clams absorb everything from the water, they are like sponges,” she says. “At that time, I can’t imagine they were checking the waters they were brought in from, so there was a high risk that you wouldn’t be eating the cleanest or the purest oysters.” And anything that can wreak gastrointestinal havoc is a no-no if you want good skin.In addition to Laszlo’s prescription, Monroe also reportedly slathered her skin with Vaseline before her daily baths.“Marilyn Monroe had the most luminous skin I ever saw,” Oscar-nominated grande dame Renée Taylor said in November at an event celebrating 50 years of the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. “She came into class with [method acting instructor] Lee Strasberg one day, and I just had to ask what she did. Marilyn told me, ‘I rub my entire body down with Vaseline and then get into a three-hour hot bath every morning. It gives my skin a shiny glow.’ So I tried that. I almost drowned.”But Russak says not to throw too much water on Monroe’s lavish tub time.“Too much water can actually really dry out the skin. We teach our clients to apply moisturizer right after the shower, while skin is still wet,” she says. “Marilyn was doing the reverse, but the idea is the same: She’s protecting her skin from the water — Vaseline provides a barrier. If she just took a three-hour bath every day, her skin would’ve been like a raisin.”

65,https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/s-mag/2020-12-17-lungile-loves/,"Witht the holiday season upon us, albeit a slightly different one, you might be looking to try some exciting trends for the season.Lungile Thabethe, head make-up artist, at MRP's Scarlet Hill, shares her quickfire beauty tips.Secret beauty hack? I am absolutely obsessed with following my skin cleansing regimen with an ice cube which eliminates puffiness especially around the eyes, reduces inflammation, and tightens pores. Makeup techniques to practise? I have been perfecting the glitter-lip trend while cosied up at home and cannot wait to rock this look during a night out.During a live video with Scarlet Hill, I also found myself spontaneously using liquid lipstick to colour my lashes a bright pink, so there has been a fair amount of experimenting in this part of town.This article first appeared in the June 2020 print edition of S Mag. The Sowetan’s quarterly lifestyle magazine.   ",6.49,10,3.98,9.16,2.82,143
66,https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/lipstick-tips-how-influencers-are-making-over-beauty-marketing,"British makeup guru Katie Jane Hughes posts close-up photos of her face on Instagram almost daily for her 336,000 followers: shimmery gold eyelids; glossy pink lips that complement her auburn hair; eyebrows tinted with tiny brushstrokes of brown gel to fix her mistake in overplucking as a teenager. And, in a video tutorial on YouTube, in which Hughes starts with a scrubbed-clean face (revealing some of the same splotchy spots many of us worry about), she demonstrates how she applies layer after layer of creams and cosmetics to achieve a glamorous look. “This tingles a little bit when you put it on, but that’s normal because it’s got glycolic in it,” Hughes says, glancing between the camera and a mirror as she massages a moisturizer into her skin. “I don’t really quite understand how glycolic face creams work. All’s I can tell you is, my skin has been amazing ever since I started using this product.” During the video’s 12-plus minutes of step-by-step instructions, Hughes holds up product after product close to the camera so viewers can get a good look at each brand name. Because, after all, Hughes isn’t merely sharing beauty tips. She’s also selling makeup.While Hughes is not your typical celebrity cover girl, her social media posts compel thousands of customers to purchase the products she recommends. New research shows that “influencers” like Hughes are changing the face of the beauty industry, attracting cult-like followings on social media, particularly Instagram and YouTube. In the competition for the consumer’s attention, influencers are winning with pretty packages of photos and videos, as consumers increasingly reject more traditional forms of marketing like TV commercials and magazine ads—even those with smiling celebrities pitching beauty products—as less credible and less trustworthy, according to research by recent Harvard Business School MBA graduate Alessia Vettese.“People used to watch celebrities on the red carpet talking about what they were wearing, or they would flip through magazines and look at celebrities in makeup ads, but that has lost its traction, especially among younger consumers,” says Vettese, who surveyed consumers and interviewed Hughes for the research project. “Now, people want to go online and get an at-your-fingertips experience. They want to ask an influencer questions and get personal responses.” This shift is challenging for many longtime players in the beauty market, prompting some legacy companies to trade vamping models for online tutorials featuring more “regular people” as they struggle to play catchup with cutting-edge brands that partnered with influencers much earlier in the game.“These established brands are facing a loss of credibility as they are being disrupted by direct-to-consumer brands,” says Vettese, whose research project was guided by HBS professor Geoffrey Jones, Isidor Straus Professor of Business History.“They can see the success of Glossier, a brand that was not around five years ago, but is now considered a billion-dollar company. So they’re now trying to seek partnerships with influencers who have clout, but they’re competing with newer brands that have done this well from the get-go.” Global spending on influencer marketing has skyrocketed in recent years, rising from an estimated $2 billion in 2017 to about $8 billion in 2019. One forecast shows that spending is expected to jump to $15 billion by 2022. In fact, beauty giant Estée Lauder revealed last week that the company is now spending 75 percent of its marketing budget on influencers.To study just how much influence influencers have on consumers, Vettese surveyed 520 women, specifically targeting beauty enthusiasts on Facebook who use such keywords as “beauty,” “skincare,” and “makeup.” These women buy a whole lot of makeup. More than 40 percent said they purchase multiple products each month.A whopping 62 percent of the women said they follow beauty influencers on social media. When asked where they seek information about beauty products prior to purchasing them, social media influencers ranked highest at nearly 67 percent, followed by third-party product reviews at 59 percent, and beauty professionals at 55 percent. Company advertisements ranked much lower at 44 percent, and public figures and celebrities garnered only 34 percent. In evaluating beauty products, the women said they trust third-party product reviews most and company advertisements least. And they said influencer marketing sways their purchasing decisions most, while direct-mail marketing is the least effective way to reach them.When asked which social media channels they visit most, Instagram was at the top, used daily by 82 percent of respondents; Facebook ranked second at 77 percent; and YouTube was third at 59 percent. “Instagram is by far the best volume play,” Vettese says. “It’s very visual, and it’s simple to put a lot of photos and short videos out there to immediately reach your followers. Plus, you can directly respond to people’s comments, so there’s this easy communication back and forth.”Many consumers also said they turn to YouTube for longer how-to videos, where they can watch influencers apply products and find inspiration. “YouTube tutorials will forever be my beauty engagement hotspot,” one consumer said in her survey response. Brands often pay influencers to peddle products—and the women surveyed weren’t naïve to that fact. Still, they find the notion of hyping products for money off-putting. While 42 percent said they would purchase a product that a company paid an influencer to promote, another 43 percent said they were unsure, and 15 percent said they would not.In fact, many of the respondents said they only follow influencers who openly disclose their endorsement deals. “Sometimes it’s hard to tell which beauty products are sponsored and which ones aren’t,” one consumer said. “I only trust influencers who are clear about whether they’re being paid!”That’s important, Vettese says, because consumers actively seek out influencers who share the same skin tones and even skin sensitivities, and they want to trust that influencers actually believe in and use the products they talk about. Consumers are paying close attention, too, so the slightest slipup can jeopardize their sense of trust.“Kim Kardashian promotes all kinds of products all the time that I’m skeptical she uses,” one consumer said. “She’ll post an Instagram holding a jar of Olay, for example, but then you’ll read an interview where she says she always uses a $1,000 Guerlain cream. A celebrity putting their name on something isn’t really enough to draw me in by itself.”We're asking Working Knowledge readers to share their thoughts on social media and influencer marketing. Many consumers look for influencers who are willing to give products negative reviews, since it’s considered a sign of legitimacy. “I appreciate honest reviews (and) feedback about everything,” one consumer said. “Nobody is going to just love every product. Therefore, an influencer builds a reputable reputation with me when they are able to say, ‘I didn’t like this product as much as …’ or ‘This product didn’t work as well for me because …’”The women surveyed weren’t necessarily drawn to the influencers with the largest online followings. Many preferred to follow lesser-known folks, called “microinfluencers,” noting that people with a smaller fan base tend to respond more to their questions and comments on posts. Some of the women surveyed talked about their influencers as though they were friends. Maybe that’s because influencers don’t post only about makeup; they often provide glimpses into their personal lives through photos of the clothes they wear, the food they eat, the places they travel, and even their spouses, kids, and friends. “These consumers are building relationships, and they are bonding with these influencers,” Vettese says. “They have regular conversations back and forth, and they think of the influencers as being directly ingrained in their day-to-day lives.”Some of the most popular beauty influencers the consumers mentioned include Jeffree Star, Tati Westbrook, James Charles, Jaclyn Hill, Laura Lee, Desi Perkins, Huda Kattan, Kylie Jenner, Nikkie de Jager, and Manny Mua.The women surveyed said they want the makeup they purchase to suit their particular skin types—and some said they felt like they weren’t previously represented in traditional company ads because those ads weren’t inclusive enough. Beauty companies should create products and enlist influencers that reach people with a variety of ethnicities, skin tones, and skin sensitivities, Vettese says.“When Kendall Jenner said she suffered from acne, people really responded to that because they could relate,” she says. “Consumers look for influencers who speak to them or look like them or have the same struggles they do.” The lessons from Vettese’s research apply not just to beauty brands, but to other industries as well, she says: “Figure out which social media channels will attract your audience, be deliberate about how you showcase your products on different channels, and make sure the people who represent your company will be seen as authentic, trusted voices of the image you want to present.”

67,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53468051,"By Yvette TanBBC NewsFor many of us, face masks have become an essential part of everyday life thanks to the coronavirus. But regularly wearing one can have an unfortunate side-effect: mask-induced acne, aka ""maskne"". ""Maskne is absolutely real. No questions asked,"" Dr Mona Gohara, Associate Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, told the BBC.""I wear two masks and sometimes a protective shield… [and] have myself experienced it and continue to experience it.""It's a frustrating scenario that anyone who's had unwanted spots can probably sympathise with.According to dermatologist Angeline Yong, the ""constant rubbing of the masks against our skin causes micro-tears, allowing easier entry for bacteria and dirt to clog up our pores"".And then there's that moist, damp environment going on underneath your mask. ""Breathing into a mask also creates a hot and moist environment that leads to the build-up of sweat, oil and bacteria. Add on the fact that face masks are occlusive [designed to block things] by nature, and it's a recipe for skin disaster,"" says Dr Yong, whose practice is based in Singapore. Dr Yong says she tells her clients one way to combat maskne is to ""avoid thick, occlusive skincare creams"".""I always tell my patients to opt for more lightweight water-based products underneath the mask... a lightweight moisturiser can also act as an additional protective barrier and prevent chafing,"" she says. ""Ideally, you should [also] be using a mild and gentle exfoliator to ... support the absorption of your moisturiser.""Perhaps unsurprisingly, skincare companies have been quick to recognise the rise of maskne.Popular Korean skincare brand Dr Jart now has a special ""Maskne Essentials"" category on its site - with items like a ""facial barrier mask"" and an anti-blemish patch.  According to beauty giant L'Oréal, the past few months have seen a ""strong rise in deep-cleansing products"".Jochen Zaumseil, L'Oréal's executive-vice president in Asia-Pacific, said popular skincare brands like La Roche-Posay and CeraVe had seen a ""huge boom"" recently - with a rise in demand for products like cleansers and sheet masks. In Asia-Pacific, this rise in deep-cleansing products was attributed to mask-related issues, including issues like oilier skin and acne, as well as an increase in hygiene habits due to Covid-19.""Skincare has always been by far our number one [revenue driver], [but] of course that's shifted even further [ahead] during the crisis,"" said Mr Zaumseil. But while skincare is booming, the makeup industry has taken a hit as more people work from home and avoid heading out.Mr Zaumseil says demand for makeup is expected to rise again as life returns to normal, businesses begin to re-open, and more people start going into work. According to L'Oréal, this is what it's witnessed in China, which is several months ahead of most of the world in coping with the virus.It found that some 34% of Chinese women wore makeup in February, during the peak of the lockdown - this figure has now increased to 68% in late June to early July.However, L'Oréal says there's been a consistent demand for products that show up above people's face masks.""The eyes are the most visible part of your face now, [so] mascara, eyeliner, these are doing very well,"" said Mr Zaumseil.Lightweight products are proving popular, as are long-lasting, non-smudge lipsticks that will not transfer onto masks.On YouTube, the trend has echoed across the beauty industry, and a growing number of vloggers are making mask-friendly makeup tutorial videos.Heavy contoured looks are out, and bold eyes are in. ""You're focusing more on eyebrows, eyeshadows - because you do have something that covers half your face. I like really bushy eyebrows and a really bold, colourful eye palette, just glamming up the eyes to help you stand out,"" US YouTuber Melina Basnight told the BBC.""I also put on some light makeup on the rest of my face because there are times you take off your mask when you go outside. I've kinda perfected what works.""Ms Basnight, who is a discharge assistant at a Texas hospital, is required to wear a mask every day at work.""[Earlier this year] I had a few people asking me how [to put on makeup with a mask] and at that point I had already been wearing masks for a few weeks,"" she said.""A lot of people still want to wear makeup even with their masks. It just provides a sense of normalcy. At a time where nothing is normal, it's just that tiny thing you can hold on to.""So she decided to create a mask-friendly makeup tutorial on her MakeupMenaree channel.Filipino YouTuber Nina Carpio said she was inspired to focus on the issue back in May - after experiencing first-hand the damage a full face of makeup dealt to her skin. The combination of makeup and perspiration under a mask, she says, irritated her skin and caused her pores to clog. The makeup also transferred to the underside of her mask, dirtying it.""I tried putting on a full [face] of makeup with foundation, powder, contour… I found it will not work. [So for now] I skip everything. I put on the face and lips, and just put products like moisturisers and lip balm,"" said the YouTuber, whose channel is Smile Like Nina.And this trend, she says, is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.""As long as we are still living in the pandemic, face masks will become part of our everyday - and so [our] makeup looks will definitely revolve around it.""Why have attitudes to face masks changed?Why are Americans so angry about masks?Why men are less likely to wear face masksWhy some countries wear face masks and others don't'I'm sure I'll hate myself when my Botox runs out'India passes 20 million cases amid oxygen shortageOfficials say infections are slowing, but erratic testing and under-reporting cast doubt on their claims.Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituencyMexico City metro overpass collapse kills 23Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituencyModi loses a battle in the 'war for Indian democracy'How rising sea levels are threatening my home.

There are about a million beauty tips floating around out there on the internet—but that definitely doesn’t mean we should be following every single one of them. A YouTube or Instagram account does not a beauty expert make, but when working makeup artists, hairstylists, skincare gurus and beauty editors are offering up advice, you better believe we’re listening!From secrets about how to style your hair without heat to brilliant ways to fix a broken compact case, the more beauty tips you have in your arsenal, the better you’ll be prepared to handle every situation thrown at you. Here are the things we think everyone should know.101. “Always keep your summer makeup minimal. Minimal and sheer makeup is the way to go when it’s hot and muggy outside.” — Mary Greenwell, celebrity makeup artist100. “The best thing to do when you go to a makeup counter is be armed with what it is you want to do.”— Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador99. Use excess eye cream on cuticles. The more you hydrate your cuticles, the stronger your nails will be.98. For smudge-proof eye makeup, take blotting tissue to remove any oil or any excess makeup from the eye area. Then, apply a small dab of cream concealer to hold things in place.97. “A good perfume should consist of balanced blend of notes arranged in a way that creates harmonious accord.”— Alexis Bergman, P&G’s Global Flavor and Fragrance Trends96. To prevent hair color from fading in the summer months, use a conditioning treatment weekly or bi-monthly.95. Breakout before a big event? “Take oral cortisone a few days before the event to clear your skin.”— Ava Shamban, dermatologist and author of Heal Your Skin.94. “In order to keep eyeliner from running and smearing, opt for liner formulas that offer stayproof wearability.”— Robin Schoen, Urban Decay Makeup Artist93. Always allow about two fingers from your nose to where blush starts.92. “Make sure you hydrate the skin and put on a primer.”— Jessie Powers, makeup artist and national educator for Make Up For Ever91. “Balance out your shimmer. If you’re doing a shimmery eye, opt for a matte lipstick.”— Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador90. Brush out your curls with your fingers to give your hair a more tousled look.89. To make your manicure last, apply a thin layer of clear every two days. Pay particular attention to the free edge at the top of your nails, where chips usually happen, and apply extra clear polish there.88. Wear white eyeliner in your water line to make eyes appear less red.87. “Take a shimmery gloss to the center of your lips, top and bottom—this will attract light to your lips, making them look pouty.”— Katrina Barrion, makeup artist for Giella Custom Blend Cosmetics86. For slicked back hair, use a hair serum.85. For the perfect cat-eye, “select a thin liner brush that is tapered to the point” and use a gel eyeliner for extra saying power. — Pamela Taylor, makeup artist.84. To make your cheek bones appear higher, use bronzer under the cheekbone and highlighter on the actual cheekbone, and remember to blend. Contouring at its finest!83. Before you blow dry, start with a volumizing spray or light gel to give the roots some lift. Pull the brush up towards the ceiling to really boost volume.82. For fuller lips, extend the lip line using a flesh tone lip liner. Be careful not to go overboard.81. The #1 reason for flaky mascara is that the formula is too dry or old. Make sure to close mascara after use to help keep its moisture. To extend the life a bit, add 2-3 drops of saline solution into the tube and swirl the brush around.80. To fake clear skin when you notice a pimple, “Apply tea tree oil as soon as you spot it”— Stephanie Flor, makeup artist.79. “It’s easy to forget that feet can get sunburned. Be sure to apply sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 50 when barefoot.”— Dr. Leslie Campbell, DPM.78. For acne-free skin, look for a cleanser with salycilic acid or benzoyl peroxide.77. When choosing a red lipstick, you just want to remember to get one that looks good with your undertone. If you have a warm undertone, then go for warmer reds, and if you have a cool undertone, then go cooler.76. Sunscreens that claim to provide “all-day protection” and “water resistance” are not reliable; don’t be fooled by these claims and reapply all sunscreens at least every 2-3 hours.75. When self-tanning, use a tanner with a guide color. “It will give you instant color before the effect and it will show you exactly where you put the color and where you may have missed.”— Sinead Norenius, founder of Beautisol.74. “If you’re afraid of red lipstick, I love putting it on and then blotting it off to wear it as more of a stain”— Pat McGrath, makeup artist. Another way to make it less intense? Apply with your fingertip instead of straight from the tube.73. For the summer months, you don’t want to be caked down in foundation, so try a tinted moisturizer or BB cream instead.72. Use blotting papers to manage oil and shine in your T-Zone, “which are also great for cleaning up around the eyes”— Rebecca Restrepo, makeup artist.71. The antihistamines in allergy medicine dry out the skin, so skip heavy foundation during allergy season. Instead, use a tinted moisturizer.70. To make curls last, make sure hair is completely dry before you begin with the curling iron. Also, use a heat protectant spray with hold on damp hair to keep hair protected.69. To make a zit go away faster, don’t pick at it. The bacteria on your fingers will create more redness, and any attempt at popping will make things worse.68. Use an exfoliator to get rid of dead skin, but limit yourself to 2-3 times a week so you don’t dry out your skin. Use a gentler scrub on your face and a coarser scrub on the rest of your body.67. Always wash your makeup off before bed. “That morning-after look has never been a good one, for anyone.”— Rachel Adler, beauty director66. “Too much bronzer is a nightmare for pale skin”— Jason Ascher, resident beauty expert for Barneys New York65. Pick a sulfate-free shampoo, as sulfates can be harsh and drying on the hair cuticle.64. If you have greasy hair, avoid directly conditioning roots and condition from your ear down to ends.63.”When you wear a red lip it’s important that it stays exactly where you put it. Using a long wearing lip pencil to create the perfect shape and a lip color are key to having a perfect red lip.”— Kristofer Buckle, celebrity makeup artist62. To make volume last all day, avoid running your fingers through hair. “Oil from your hands can weigh down your roots leaving your hair flat at the end of the day”— Tatum Neill, Arrojo Studio61. Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair dry and your scalp will create more oils to compensate for the loss of moisture. Instead, use a dry shampoo and style your hair into a braid or ponytail when it’s a bit more oily.60. Always use a moisturizer with SPF in the morning. Even in the winter!59.”Go for a trim every 6-8 weeks to ensure you have no damaged ends making your hair look unhealthy”— Nick Arrojo, Arrojo Studio (and the man who worked for seven years changing lives on What Not To Wear)58. Remember, clean your makeup brushes to fight against potential bacteria and breakouts. At least once a week, swirl brushes around in a mixture of warm water and mild soap, then lay flat to dry.57. Clean out your makeup bag at least once a year to get rid of old products that may be expired or you no longer use.56. Winter can be especially harsh on your hair leaving it extra dry. Eugene Davis, celebrity hair stylist suggests using an Avocado Oil Hair Mask.55. If you don’t have nail polish remover, apply clear nail polish over your nail, and then wipe off. It will remove old polish.54. During the summer, wear lip balm or gloss with SPF.53. To add volume to clean or unwashed hair, use a dry shampoo spray.52.Change your beauty routine for spring and summer months. Your skin needs less coverage during the spring so you can swap the heavy, winter products for lighter ones.51.”I always think that less is more. There’s a point where you look in the mirror and say ‘Is this too much?’ and if you even have that inclination then it usually is.”— Kim Catrall, “Sex and the City”50. When applying bronzer, “first start by applying it around the perimeter of your face and follow with a light dusting on your forehead, nose and chin.”— Mally Roncal, Mally Beauty.49. To get curls when you have straight hair, use, “a volumizer or volume thickening agent, a curl enhancing product, light holding finishing spray.”— Vicktor Stevenson, Hair Stylist.48.”Foundation should never be heavy.”— Aura Schwartz, makeup artist. Apply liquid foundation with a damp makeup sponge for best results.47.”The right red [lipstick] will light up your hair, eyes and skin immediately, the wrong one will not.”— Poppy King, Lipstick Queen46. To clean up the flick of a cat eye, use a dampened, pointed Q-tip.45.To revive curls mid-day, “Take a very small amount of pomade and put it in the palms of your hands. Rub them together. Next gently smooth the pomade over your curls and scrunch just a little bit.”— Eugene Davis, celebrity hair stylist44.”You should always go to a hair-removal specialist, where waxing, laser etc. is their main business – don’t go to a nail salon for a wax”— Cindy Barshop, Completely Bare and Bravo’s “RHONYC”43.”A little silvery-blue eyeliner on the lower lid is very flirty.”— Dimitri James, makeup artist, author and creator of Skinn Cosmetics42.”Use your concealer as a base on your eyelids.”— Melissa Silver, Maybelline makeup artist. Concealer will help to absorb oil and your eyeshadow will stick to the product instead of your lids, making it stay longer.41. If you’re not a fan of liquid liner, get the look of liquid eye liner by using a gel instead.40. Exfoliate before applying self tanner to get rid of dead skin. Tanning products tend to cling to drier areas and rougher areas, like your knees and elbows, so make sure they’re moisturized first.39. If you straighten your hair with a flat-iron, cause less heat damage by letting hair air dry. The less heat, the better!38. To minimize pores, use a pore-minimizing facial wash followed by a toner. Make sure the toner is alchohol-free so it won’t dry out your skin.37. The healthier you are, the healthier your hair! Take a daily multi-vitamin with Biotin to help hair grow faster.36.To mask split ends, use an iron to straighten ends and then apply a hair repair cream.35.There are always cheap, natural and effective homemade beauty recipes.34.To fix brassy hair color, use a color-depositing shampoo with purple tones. For unwanted redness, use a color-depositer with a green tone.33. To cover up roots in a hurry, use a dry shampoo spray for your hair color. If you don’t keep this product around, use eyeshadow (in a shade closest to your hair color) for a quick fix.32. Get a “dewy glow” using a highlighter or illuminator above your cheekbones and on the brow bone, just underneath your eyebrows.31. To contour cheeks, use a matte powder (a few shades darker than your skin tone) with an angled brush. Blend on temples and under cheek bone.30.When using a cream product (blush or eyeshadow), lock it in by using a translucent powder over it.29. Get quick volume by using a root lifter, then use hairspray to set hair. This will prevent it from falling flat during the day.28. For makeup that lasts all day and night, use a makeup-sealing product like a setting spray.27. To help you find the right shade of foundation, choose the product you think is closest to your color and try it on your jaw line in natural light. You will be able to easily compare it to your neck’s color to see if you need to go for a different undertone, lighter or darker.26. Try out the funky hair color trends without dyeing your hair. Instead, dust bright blush in your ponytail for the same effect. (Refinery29)25. “Foot perspiration is typical in the summer and can lead to fungal infection and unwanted odor. Wash feet daily, and let them dry thoroughly before putting shoes on.”— Dr. Leslie Campbell, DPM.24. Splurge on items that are important to you.”If mascara is really your thing and you fall in love with a mascara that’s $40, buy the mascara.”— Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador23.”Don’t be too serious: It’s only Makeup! “— Francois NARS insists you play around with new colors.22. To reduce unwanted shine, use a moisturizer that mattifies your skin. That way you get the moisture your skin needs without looking greasy.21. To create a lived-in look for your hair, use thickening or sea-salt mist before you blow-dry. Follow by running a volumizing or texture cream through hair.20. When using an eyeshadow primer, only place the primer where you’ll be adding color.19.”Cream rouge [blush] should be the first thing that touches your cheeks when you want to project an image of healthy and pinched cheeks.”— Pablo Manzoni, former creative director for Elizabeth Arden18. If you choose to use false eyelashes, remember to use the dark glue as it will blend in with the lashes.17. When buying “organic” beauty products, make sure to check if they are FDA certified organic. This will prevent you from getting scammed.16. Use a facial exfoliater bi-weekly to get dead skin of dead skin. Makeup will look better on a clean, smooth canvas.15. After using a hair conditioning mask, follow with “a cold water rinse to close the hair cuticles.”— Ursala Stephensen, celebrity stylist.14. To get your braid to last all day, try styling hair that’s dirty with product. This will make the style stick longer.13. Use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get rid of any product build-up that may have occurred during the week.12. If you have chipped nail polish, add glitter on top to disguise the look of chipping.11. Use a pumice stone on your feet after the shower to get rid of calluses.10. Hydrate your under-eye area with an eye cream to prevent puffiness and bags.9. If you have light hair,”put a lotion over the eyebrows and hair-line” when self-tanning the face. Also remember to “apply it in circular motions and blend down to the neck.”— Sinead Norenius, founder of Beautisol8. If you often find yourself being too tired to wash your face at night, keep makeup removing wipes in your night stand to prevent a runny mess or morning break out.7. Pop 1-2 Advil before going waxing to prevent pain.6. The best way to get rid of ingrown hairs is to exfoliate,”which rids the skin of dead cells and allows the hair to break through the surface.”— Marlena Ramoy, Bliss Spa esthetician.5. Carrots are good for the hair. A healthy diet leads to a beautiful you.4.”The best time to apply creams is after the shower, as the skin has been de-oiled.”— Dr. Stephen P. Bracci3. Replace mascara and liquid eyeliner after 3-4 months.2. To keep hair color vibrant longer, use shampoos and conditioners formulated for colored hair.1. Use a cream or milk cleanser to wash your face. Creams are less drying than gels.Originally published August 2014. Updated May 2017.

69,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-quarantines-are-upending-beauty-routines/608689/,"If you’re stuck at home and feeling out of sorts, it might be time to experiment with a box of hair dye.As the coronavirus pandemic shut down cities and cloistered people indoors around the world, images began to circulate online of what appeared to be nature retaking territory it had previously ceded to humans. In Japan, deer wandered into transit stations looking for food. In Venice, another post claimed, swans alighted on the normally traffic-clogged canals, the waters of which were clear enough to spy fish below the surface.Some of the photos were hoaxes—the deer were real; the clear canal waters, less so. Nonetheless, people seemed fascinated with the idea that the world humans have created for themselves could begin to fade so quickly. But many of us don’t need to look to faraway cities on social media for proof that our grip on the natural world is faltering. We can simply look in the mirror.Quarantine cuts people off from their daily life in ways that are both immediately obvious and imminently catastrophic. Millions of people lost their livelihood, their social-support systems, or both in the course of only a few days. As isolation becomes normal, though, its toll begins to emerge in more subtle ways, including on the body itself. Suddenly barred from hair and nail salons, waxers, barber shops, clothing stores, and Sephora, people have found it much more difficult to maintain the routines that structure their appearance.The last luxury I allowed myself before committing to an indeterminate period of isolation was getting my roots colored. It felt deeply silly to be concerned about my hair, among all the other, more pressing fears I had about food supplies and job stability and the safety of my elderly parents and asthmatic brother. But as I talked with friends and watched strangers on social media in the days after my own salon trip, I found they were doing similar things: going to the barber, getting acrylic nails filled in or removed, making one last appointment to get their eyebrows threaded, buying clippers to fend for themselves.Read: What you’re feeling is plague dreadThe commonality of the compulsion to beautify cast my own graying temples in a different light. If so many people are so concerned with their appearance, then perhaps that concern goes far deeper than vanity. The care of a human body ties people to the physical, social world they’ve been abruptly forced to leave behind. Stuck inside, people are left with just their existing tools and skills, trying to maintain their sense of self, or at least their eyebrows. With people’s faces, so go their identities.For people whose identity is heavily dependent on their life outside their home, not looking like the people they’ve long understood themselves to be can be a serious stressor on top of more concrete fears about health and safety. “If you get your identity with work and you can’t work now, or you don’t have your friends and that social status and power, I think that’s going to affect you tremendously,” Amy Flowers, a psychologist who specializes in stress management and body image, told me. Flowers used herself as an example: She can dress down for only a few days at a time before she needs to put on a skirt and hosiery to tap back into the sense of order she’s used to. For others, that might mean curling their hair, putting on eye makeup, or keeping their CDC-approved mustache tidy. For many people, Flowers said, these little elements of daily life are the building blocks of psychological well-being.Even in normal life, some people think beauty routines are a waste of energy and resources. In a pandemic, you figure out which ones are worth the trouble. Sarah Sessler, a lawyer in Cincinnati, is holding on to a sense of normalcy via tinted moisturizer. “Completely abandoning my makeup and hair routine and wearing sweats all day literally makes me feel kind of like I’m already sick,” she told me in a Twitter message. “A little light makeup is weirdly … grounding?” Sticking to elements of her routine prevents her from fretting over her rosacea flare-ups, which are worse during periods of high stress. For some, tending to hair or body issues checks an easy, satisfying thing off their long list of worries. “The first thing I did was wash and deep condition my thick, curly hair and then spend two hours detangling and braiding it into four huge cornrows,” Jacqueline McCrief, a recently laid-off retail worker in Seattle, said in an email. “I don’t have to worry about it drying out and just wear a scarf over it most of the time.” A week into quarantine, McCrief is experimenting with her usual routine. “I don’t wear makeup anymore but sometimes I put on a full face for absolutely no reason,” she said.When people try to improvise in the face of disrupted routines, things can go sideways quickly. Matt Raz, a podcast and radio producer in New York City, normally has a standing appointment every three weeks to get his head shaved and beard trimmed. Last week, he missed it by a day when his barber shop closed. “I’m probably safer for it, but not being able to go out to get my hair cut made me anxious and had me ready to take matters into my own hands,” he wrote in an email. Raz, now clean-shaven, does not recommend the results, and neither does Nate Youngblood, a data scientist who also lives in New York. “I have had a short beard for probably almost ten years at this point, and had been wanting to recall how my face looked without it but was reluctant to take the leap until now,” Youngblood wrote in an email. “Turns out I look like a cross between my late mother and a boiled dumpling, so I will not be repeating this little experiment.”Read: The risk of ‘getting bangs’People dealing with mental-health issues deeply tied to appearance can face physical and psychological stakes higher than those who have never dealt with similar problems might realize. Eating disorders, for instance, thrive in isolation; anorexia in particular can be downplayed or dismissed as an effort to conserve personal food supplies. Quarantine can also cause a break from healthy routines for people dealing with gender dysphoria or body dysmorphia. “I’m no stranger to working from home every day, but I was still going out to meet up with friends and go on dates” before the COVID-19 pandemic, says Katelyn Burns, a freelance journalist and trans woman in Washington, D.C. “I don’t have those occasions anymore, so I’ve noticed that when I let things go too long, it really flares up my dysphoria.” She says that videoconferences can also be stressful—in normal conversations, people are not asked to look at their own face and mannerisms while talking with others.When the COVID-19 pandemic eventually abates, physical maintenance will be an easy way for people to start to feel like themselves again—or to mark the end of a painful era. “I wouldn’t be surprised if I have a lot of clients booking appointments for big changes for post-pandemic haircuts,” Rubi Jones, a hair stylist in New York City, wrote in an email. She’s one of thousands of stylists, nail technicians, and barbers whose businesses have ground to a halt because of the pandemic. “I have a feeling we’ll all want to shed some of the heaviness of this time off our heads,” Jones said. Flowers, the psychologist, seconded this prediction. “A lot of people change their appearance when they have a change of situation,” she told me. “It’s a task, it’s a mission, and that makes us feel good.” Across social media, you can see indications that’s already happening: Instead of worrying about haircuts and coloring, lots of people appear to be shaving their head for quarantine.Cutting all your hair off might seem dramatic—as might worrying about how you look at all during a global pandemic—but Flowers said that fretting over these things and doing what you can to assert yourself is a natural and predictable response in the face of enormous stress. “It’s about people trying to control what they can, because the reality is, we can’t control this virus,” she told me. Boxed hair dye and YouTube beauty tutorials are not the way to solve a global crisis. But maybe, while that global crisis rages on, you can solve your hair.",6.79,10,4.9,9.41,2.85,1408
70,https://www.mamamia.com.au/makeup-tips-women-over-40/,"Life in your 40s is the jam. You're no longer battling the insecurities you did in your 20s and 30s, and you've finally reached a place where you feel comfortable in your own skin. Go you!And while your skincare routine has probably changed for the better (Serums! Eye creams! SPF!), more often than not you'll still be rocking the same makeup routine as you did years ago (give or take a few products).Watch: Wanna just get to the good bit already? Here's three top tips for anti-ageing makeup. Post continues below.The thing is, though - your skin changes in your 40s. A lot. You'll start to notice things like lines and wrinkles around your mouth, forehead and eyes, maybe some pigmentation, dryness and all that other fun stuff. This means that makeup starts to sit differently on our faces. Listen: Speaking of fun things that happen to your skin when you age... listen to this episode of YouBeauty, where Leigh talks about the product that made her eye bags disappear.We know, we know - upgrading your products and making adjustments to your usual routine is easier said than done. Like, where do you even start with something like that? Because we're not professionals, we asked a celebrity makeup artist for a few tricks that'll instantly up your game.""I see a lot of incorrect shade choices,"" said celebrity makeup legend Michael Brown. ""We often want a natural fresh look as we age, but some tones that you use in your 20s and even 30s, like browns and nudes, just aren’t as flattering in our 40s.""Don't make that face. We love browns and nudes just as much as you do.""My advice would be to lift everything. If you use a cream and brown eye palette, add some peach or a warmer hint of colour, than say a standard caramel or chocolate brown which can appear flat,"" advises Brown.Want another sneaky tip? Brown said a touch of blush on the centre of the eyelid works a treat, making the eyes appear brighter and more lifted.And this rule doesn't just go for eyes, friends.""This also works with lip shades. Deeper tones can thin out lips and full nude tones might wash you out. Instead, go for a fresher colour - once again like a peach, or brick-style pink to bring colour to the face.""Dull and cakey makeup sucks. But the thing is - your makeup game is only as good as your skin game. After all, you can't expect your poor old makeup to do ALL the work for you.Making sure your skin feels moisturised and hydrated is key to achieving good makeup. Not only will you find that you can use less makeup, but you'll also find that what you do use will blend more seamlessly on your skin - because it's all plump and moisturised.One way to do this is to incorporate a nourishing facial oil into your routine.""Use a face oil at night to maximise hydration and nourishment while you sleep. In the morning, dab a couple of drops on your cheekbones only, as this is where light reflects the most and where we can see ageing - this will make your foundation sit perfectly, add glow and overall give a more translucent makeup look.""*Bookmarks amazing foundation tip*.We know we just told you to up your skincare game, but just be wary of what moisturiser you're using.""For under makeup I recommend sticking to lighter textures that are fast-absorbing and plump skin instantly. Keep rich creams for night-time use when they have more time to absorb slowly while you sleep,"" said Brown.Got it!You do, though. And it's important if you're like us and your skin eats your makeup.""I love a light dewy liquid, but unfortunately they move so much as they aren’t dense or weighted enough to stay put. Especially with long-wear foundation,"" said Brown.So, what gives?""As we start to show more expression lines and our skin is a little more on the dry side, it’s important to opt for a cream texture foundation,"" said Brown. ""This will give coverage needed, but can still be buffed out to appear natural. The difference is that it’s slightly dense in product weight, so it won’t slip and slide into any wrinkles as much as a super lightweight dewy finish foundation.""So, yeah. Stay away from those powdery or dewy formulas.Don't be boring with your makeup. Switch it up! Have fun! Ugh. But how? We hear you groan. Alright, this may sound terrifying, but um... Brown said you should totally try metallic eyeshadow. No, really. It won't make you look 'old'. We promise.""I like to play on light metallic shades to suit a fashion look, eye colour (always go opposite), or an occasion on the very centre of the eyelid. Adding this small bright pop of colour that has a built-in reflect is a game-changer. It'll add a big difference to your general eye makeup,"" said Brown.Wa-wa-wait! We're not talking full-on glitter, you silly salmon. Think creamy eyeshadow pots with sheer washes of gold, pewter or bronze. Something like Revlon ColorStay Cream Eyeshadow, $7.47 or Chanel Longwear Cream Eyeshadow, $52 if you wanna get all fancy on us.And don't go too crazy - make sure you stop at the crease to keep the look non-80s-like. ""A little goes a long way,"" said Brown. Told you.Feature: @mbrown_beauty; @revlonDo you have any tips to add? Share with us in the comment section below.

			The supermodel reveals the products she can't live without When you think of Heidi Klum, 46, her supermodel good looks and sun-kissed blonde hair probably spring  immediately to mind, so it might surprise you that the German model and TV personality has a rather down-to-earth beauty philosophy. From washing her face with unconventional, yet affordable, products to how she looks after her signature tresses, she shares all her beautiful advice with Bazaar...""Many moons ago, I read an interview with the stunning Sophia Loren, and there was a quote of hers in bold that read 'beauty is in the eye of the beheld' and that has stuck with me all of these years. Beauty is about loving and celebrating the person."" A post shared by Heidi Klum (@heidiklum)""I am not defined by my hair but I definitely think people recognise me and associate me with blonde. I’ve played with the shade over the years – almost platinum at one point and then darker, but always blonde. Years ago, Mattel actually made a Barbie doll of me for their ‘Blonde Ambition’ series. It was so exciting to be included amongst blonde icons like Marilyn Monroe and Goldie Hawn!""  ""My hairstylist is Wendy Iles and when I first met Wendy many years ago in London, I realised I had forgotten my shampoo. I asked if she had any she could spare and she gave me a tiny unlabelled little bottle to take to my room. I washed my hair and loved the way it looked after – and I’m not necessarily someone who notices the texture of a shampoo. The next day, I asked Wendy what brand it was and it was her line, Iles Formula. I love her shampoo and conditioner and I really feel a difference in my hair when I run out and have to use something else.""""I do very little to my hair. I wash it and let it air dry. I like to give it a break when I am off-camera from the hairdryers and straighteners and curling irons. Sometimes, I will put it in a messy bun if I am going out to dinner but, overall, I like it when it has a bit of natural texture and wave to it without being overdone or full of products.""  A post shared by Heidi Klum (@heidiklum)""I have added sunscreen to my daily routine.  I grew up without a lot of awareness of how important it is to keep your skin protected from the sun. I remember tanning with baby oil – can you imagine doing that now? I have always been a sun bum. I’m at my happiest on a beautiful beach in the hot sun but, now, I put on sunscreen first. I like the tinted sunscreen by La Roche Posay.""  ""In the morning, I take a shower and wash my face with Johnson & Johnson's Baby Shampoo. I use baby shampoo as a face wash as it is the most gentle for your face and it removes everything. Then, I put on a moisturiser, usually Mario Badescu’s Buttermilk Lotion. At the end of my day, even if I am exhausted, I always wash off my make-up. For removing eye make-up, I again use baby shampoo. Then, I try different moisturisers at night that are a bit richer – I like Vintner’s Daughter Active Botanical Serum or Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Oil.""""I definitely think that you can buy all the potions and creams but it is essential to nourish your skin from within. I drink a fresh smoothie every morning that is made from fresh fruit and vegetables, and I take two Perfectil Vitamins which are targeted for my skin, hair and nails.""A post shared by Perfectil (@perfectilofficial)""When I am not working, I try to keep it very natural. Most days I don’t wear any make-up but, if I am running errands, I use a bit of a light base to even out my skin tone and a bit of blush for my cheeks to give it a bit of a glow. I like Anastasia Beverly Hills' Brow Pencil and Gel too.""If I am going out with my husband [the German guitarist Tom Kaulitz] to dinner, I may be a bit more bold by painting on a red lip or adding some more mascara, like L’Oreal's Voluminous Mascara for a more dramatic eye. I think make-up should be fun so I like to try different eyeshadows and colours."" ""Lip balm in pots because you keep sticking your finger in repeatedly and it gets germs in the product."" ""I love fragrances! I try many but I always gravitate towards something exotic and not to floral. I am a big fan of Hermes' L’Ambre des Merveilles but I switch it up depending on my mood.""A post shared by Heidi Klum (@heidiklum)""I try to eat as healthy as I can. We have a big vegetable garden and every night we make a giant salad from it for dinner. When I am working, I try to fill up on snacks l enjoy like fruit, greek yogurt or almonds instead of chips and cookies from the craft service table. But, don’t get me wrong, some days there is nothing better than a Big Mac, fries with mayo and a Coca-Cola!""""I like running on the treadmill but my schedule fluctuates a lot so I don’t always work it into my day. I have to be creative of where I get my exercise in. I  jump on the trampoline with my kids or have a nightly after-dinner dance party or we take our dogs for a hike.""""Beauty, like fashion, is not one size fits all.

Blige keeps her smoky eyes muted and cheats the crease by using a soft gray on lids and just above the eye socket fold. Julianne Moore has matte apricot lips. En español | There are thousands of beauty tricks that make a difference in your looks — especially if you’re a woman age 50-plus. But who has time for all that? Let me show you a shortcut to the best of the best. As a beauty editor, I’ve watched top pros use these tips on magazine shoots with grownup celebs and everyday women for decades. They’re timeless and do work. Here are 10 from my greatest hits list. Swipe lipstick on your thumb and foundation, concealer and shadow in the web between thumb and forefinger. No more wiping clean the store tester and applying to your face or the back of your hand, please. Not only is it unhygienic, it’s not realistic. Test on skin similar to the area where the product will be used. The soft, fleshy blue-red pad of your thumb is more like actual lip skin and gives a truer idea of lipstick shade and texture. The web of skin near your thumb is thinner, looser and crinkled — it will show how face makeup or eye shadow will look when applied, blended and worn.It really does help counteract gravity, and it sidekicks saggy skin and deep expression lines. Blend on creams, serums and oils in gentle sweeping movements, working from the center of your face outward. In the short term, it gets the circulation going, helps products melt into skin and feels soothing — in the long term, it minimizes the downward pull. Makeup artists, day spa aestheticians, facialists and the teeny print instructions sheet that comes with luxury face creams wouldn’t have it any other way! Start at the base of your neck and work upwards to the jawline. Then sweep outward along the jawline, from chin to ears, beneath nose to cheekbones to temples, in a big C. Blend eye cream from inner eye near the nose, in a hammock following the under eye. You’re subtly lifting the face as you massage up and out.Unless you have tattooed or microbladed your eyebrows, or have genetically gifted strong full brows — your own are not what they used to be. Filling and extending your brow shape before jumping to liner, shadow and mascara gives your eye area a brand-new bigger frame. This “window” will affect how much eye makeup you need or want — and maybe it's not as much as you thought. Dark hair? Go one or two shades lighter in brow makeup. Light hair? Go one or two shades darker in brow filler.Improving or inventing mature brows is a biggie, but we often pay too much attention to fullness and shape, not length. This is why even “corrected” brows fall short. Line up any pencil vertically from the outside corner of your nose to align with your inner eye corner. This is where your brow should begin. Fill in your brow with small, hairlike, upward pencil strokes, then angle the pencil from the nose to the outer corner of your eye. This is where your brow should end. Warning: Do not follow the downward curve of brow hairs that droop. Instead, cheat the line outward for a straighter look, and pluck hairs that drag your eye down. Comb brow hairs up, and fill from the bottom to top with pencil and/or powder.Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty ImagesAuthor Inara Verzemnieks lets her asymmetrical brows and lips be; check out Judy Greer’s asymmetrical brows.By age 50, unmatched features are the norm. One brow may be higher or differently shaped than the other; your top lip may have thinned to a nearly invisible line, while the bottom lip is still pouty. On your face, you may see that one side is more lined and crinkled than the other (usually the side you don’t sleep on is higher, firmer, less lined). It’s all OK. These quirky little “off” things give your face personality and individuality. Don’t strive to mask differences with makeup.Here’s a major secret: Unlike fingers, makeup sponges suck up a lot of face makeup. You end up using more makeup for each application and running out of that bottle or tube very quickly. The more expensive teardrop sponge is trendy, but those triangular ones have been around forever and do the job just as well. Use them to freshen a makeup overdose or retouch makeup during the day or evening. Simply run a makeup sponge under warm water, squeeze out the excess and dab (press, don’t swipe!) your face right over your makeup. It removes any excess color (too much foundation, blush or bronzer, for example) or makeup that has settled in crevices and lines. Carry one in a Ziploc bag in your handbag, and clean it often.Aging eyes are beautiful, but when deep, hooded or saggy, they rob your lids of space. This puts the emphasis on the droopy overhang and diminishes eye size and shape. When applying makeup forget the old rules about using a light shadow on the lid and a deeper color to contour. Instead, go darker on the lids with a medium shade (anything from gray to light brown), and blend it from the lash line straight up and over your real crease to extend above it. Keep the edge of the arc soft. This new fake crease is an illusion that expands lash to crease space, pushes back the overhang and makes eyes look bigger and stronger in shape — even before you get to liner!For more beauty tips and entertainment news, get AARP’s monthly Lifestyle newsletter.Stop applying liner on autopilot. Vary placement and line thickness according to a specific goal — and this may differ daily. You can, for example: rim upper and lower lids to really emphasize eye shape and draw attention away from underage bags or lines; line the upper lid at the lash roots and beneath them in the waterline to bring deepest eyes out; widen the top lid liner slightly at the outer end to lift the eyes; use a gray or brown liner instead of dark, inky black or chocolate for a softer look; line the lower waterline with a beige eye pencil to cancel out redness. The options are endless.Stop obsessing about those cheeky brown spots — no one else is even noticing them. Start at your nose (bridge to beneath nostrils) and its surrounding area, since this is where redness, dark circles, broken capillaries, enlarged pores require coverage. Apply foundation or your beauty balm/color-correcting (BB/CC) cream in the center, and blend outward from there toward hairline, jaw and ears, sheering the texture as you go. Then for round two, go over the area again, using a foundation brush in a back-and-forth motion every which way, like painting a wall. This forces the makeup and skin to melt together seamlessly instead of lying on top. Aim for subtle coverage with skin visible beneath.You already know lining and filling in lips with a lip-toned pencil will prevent ring around the mouth and hold the color, but you don’t know this: You can turn any lipstick into a more matte or muted one by blotting with a tissue and satin or matte powder — select from pressed to loose, even blush, a peachy, rosy, tawny eyeshadow or bronzer — any kind works. This tip softens the look of too bold bright or deep berry shades, too. Want more shimmer or shine that won’t get sloppy and slimy? Apply your usual lipstick and dab it with a glittery, shimmery powder as above.For more beauty and style tips for women age 50-plus, check out The Woman's Wakeup: How to Shake Up Your Looks, Life, and Love After 50 by Lois Joy Johnson.Please leave your comment below.You must be logged in to leave a comment.Featured AARP Member BenefitsSee All >AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that empowers people to choose how they live as they age.You are leaving AARP.org and going to the website of our trusted provider.

73,https://www.allure.com/story/summer-skin-care-tips-from-dermatologists,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.To revisit this article, select My Account, thenView saved storiesBy Leah PrinzivalliDermatologists spend summers underneath the same sun as the rest of us, but somehow their skin manages to stay clear and glowing all season long. Sure, it's part of the job description, but even the professionals have to work a bit harder to prevent breakouts and minimize sun damage during the summer months. Warm weather brings a whole slew of skin-care challenges and questions like, ""Do I really have to moisturize even if it's 100 degrees out and my face feels oily?” (Spoiler alert: Yes.) Luckily, the experts know exactly how to face summer — pun intended — head on.""A solid routine should be applicable to all seasons and all climates,"" says Omer Ibrahim, a board-certified dermatologist and codirector of clinical research at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. ""With that said, there are a couple of changes one might consider when transitioning from winter to summer."" Ahead, we asked three dermatologists for their best summer skin-care advice. Consider this your definitive road map to healthy-looking skin all season long. Meet our experts, then keep scrolling for their favorite summer skin-care hacks and yes, one final reminder to wear broad-spectrum SPF.If you're not wearing a winter coat, why should your skin? ""In the summer, I generally remind patients that just like their wardrobe, their skin-care routine may need to be a little more lightweight,"" says Ibrahim. The heat and humidity of summer means you can swap out a heavier cleanser (think cream or oil cleanser) in favor of a gentle, foaming option.To help lighten things up, Ibrahim recommends switching to a combination moisturizer and sunscreen during the summer. ""A lightweight moisturizer with SPF of 30 or higher may be plenty for most people,"" he says. In fact, Ibrahim notes that thicker moisturizers can lead to clogged pores, inflammation, and acne. Especially if you have acne-prone or oily skin, losing one skin-care step with a combination moisturizer/SPF can help keep skin clear.That extra layer of sweat on your face does not count as a moisturizer. ""Despite the weather being hot and humid, you still need to moisturize,"" says Nava Greenfield, a dermatologist and medical director at Schweiger Dermatology Group in Brooklyn, New York. Even if your skin already feels oily, you should always follow cleansing with a moisturizer.""Moisturizers reestablish the stratum corneum, your outermost layer of the skin, which protects from harmful pollutants and chemicals and prevents further irritation or dryness,"" says Ariel Ostad a board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon in New York City. This is where that combination moisturizer/SPF comes in: A lightweight texture will help keep that outer layer nourished without feeling too heavy on your skin.""Vitamin C is great year-round, but all the more important in the summer,"" says Ibrahim. Vitamin C helps prevent hyperpigmentation, improve the appearance of fine lines, and can help with collagen production. Layer a few drops on your skin between cleansing and moisturizer.Dermatologists are often reminding us not to over-exfoliate, but the summertime 'tis the season to slough away. If you have oily skin, Ostad suggests incorporating ""more exfoliation"" into your skin-care routine. That doesn't mean a daily dose of all your favorite acids, but try slowly increasing the amount of days you exfoliate per week. Ostad recommends alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) pads to ""open up blocked pores and remove oils that result in acne."" Plus they feel nice and soothing on stressed-out summer skin.Between workouts, beach days, and plain old summer sweat, many of us shower more than once a day during the summer. Ibrahim recommends keeping showers short, around four to five minutes. ""Over-showering, or showering in water that is too hot, can lead to over-drying your skin, leading to inflammation and even summertime eczema,"" he says.Take a close look at your makeup product labels and only keep those that are non-comedogenic. That's a fancy word for a product formulated without pore-clogging ingredients. Especially over the summer, Greenfield recommends her patients ""wear makeup that is not going to occlude your skin."" That might include options like a powder sunscreen, an oil-free primer, or a lightweight foundation.All our experts recommend their patients wear sun-protective clothing, wide-brim hats, and sunglasses in the sun. We don't expect you to wear a long-sleeve shirt every single moment you're on the beach, but be mindful to expose as little of your body as possible to direct sunlight. That might mean sitting underneath an umbrella, wearing an extra-large hat, or avoiding the midday sun.""Hydration is always important for our skin, but even more so in the summer,"" says Ostad. Aim for eight glasses of water a day, which Ostad promises will have ""great results"" when it comes to your skin. Hydration can also help skin recover after a sunburn — but we know you're all too smart to get those in the first place.We saved the most important, fundamental, don't-leave-home-without-it tip for last: Wear sunscreen. Each of our experts recommends a broad spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher on all exposed skin. Don't forget about hands, feet, ears, and lips. ""It is also important to note that sunscreen needs to be reapplied every couple of hours, so make sure to pack extra sunscreen for longer summer days outdoors,"" says Ibrahim. Pro tip: Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to reapply.More on summer sun care:Now, brush up on 100 years of sunscreen history:You can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.More from Allure© 2021 Condé Nast.

74,https://www.bustle.com/articles/201204-10-bizarre-beauty-tips-from-the-middle-ages-that-you-wont-believe-actually-existed,"FashionWhile compacts and makeup palettes might have been rudimentary back then, people still dabbled with pots and paints in the medieval times. But with limited ingredients and the ever-watchful eye of the church, you'd get some really weird beauty tips during the Middle Ages. Like here's-this-arsenic-for-your-face weird.You would think that rubbing a little lemon on your lips to add some color wouldn't cause such a hysteria, but the pulpit assured its parishioners that, oh, it would. According to Sarah Schaffer, author of Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power, the idea was that makeup hampered with God's vision. To add a little rouge to your cheeks or sneak some fireplace soot onto your lashes was to directly challenge spiritual authority. But like with all things that pertain to women, there was a dichotomy that they were forced to balance on.For example, according to Thomas Aquinas, a woman needed enough makeup to attract a husband and keep his eye from roving to other prettier church goers, but not so much that it attracted the attention of other men and inspired sinful thoughts. So you should wear makeup, but you definitely couldn't wear makeup. Society: Making standards of beauty for women impossible since the beginning of time.Here are 10 weird beauty tips from the middle ages that you never knew existed.Say you heard all the sermons during Sunday mass against the sins of cosmetics, but still really wanted to add some color to your lips. It wasn't quite as simple as swinging to the corner drugstore and finding your favorite shade. A lot was at stake. ""There were laws written to intimidate women into not wearing any makeup. They considered it a form of trickery or fraud to men or husbands, a misinterpretation of what you actually looked like, and therefore a crime,"" Gabriela Hernandez, author of Classic Beauty: The History of Makeup and founder of Besame Cosmetics, explains to Bustle. ""Women were so scared of being imprisoned or killed for witchcraft because of this that the use of any beauty aids diminished tremendously during this time.""But that's not to say there weren't a stubborn few that continued to dabble with their pots and paints. The most common way to add color was to use roots and flowers. ""Some items used were berries, beets and a root called alkanet. These items would be mixed with fats to make balms or used raw to rub color into the skin,"" Hernandez confirms. And there was a bit of leeway when it came to that bit of color: Society ceded enough to turn a blind eye towards lip shades in rose or lily tints because of those colors’ connotations with purity. Just as long as you didn't go too wild with berries and beets, you'd be OK.Rather than swapping secrets at the marketplace on how to best emphasize and darken their lashes, women just got rid of them altogether. ""Women in the 1400s wanted to have high foreheads and an egg-shaped face, with small nose and lips. They saw this as resembling a child, innocent and pure,"" Hernandez explains. ""It was truly a blank face, without much expression, since the hairline was tweezed to be very high and the eyebrows shaved off. The eyes were the only color left on the face, that was mostly pale and round."" So if you asked for tips on what to do with your lashes, you'd get handed a pair of tweezers.However, if you no longer wanted to participate in the fashion but your eyebrows grew back sparsely, it was in vogue to create fake brows out of... rodent fur. ""They used mice, or other furry animals in the rodent family to make small hair pieces for brows if the woman over tweezed and the hair did not grow back. This type of hair was replaced later on by human hair that came from the orient,"" Hernandez shares. The lesson in this: Make sure you know what you're doing with the tweezer.Just because there weren't any drugstores doesn't mean women didn't lighten or darken their tresses. From homemade tints to magic hair-lightening stones, the medieval women had their tricks. Flaxen hair was the preferred shade for women since angels were often depicted as blonde. In order to achieve it, some interesting measures were taken. While some would mix potions of black sulfur, honey, and alum on their head and sit in the sun to lighten their tresses, others reached for opal necklaces. ""They believed that wearing an opal necklace would keep the hair blonde. Interestingly enough, later on the opal was associated with bad luck and fell out of favor for a half century,"" Hernandez says. All you had to do was slip it around your neck and its powers would keep your hair from darkening.If you wanted to be contrary and keep your hair dark, then their were plenty of kitchen DIYs that would help you achieve those shades. ""There were many home remedies for darkening hair, and most involved roots or nuts that would be cooked and the liquid used to soak the hair. Walnuts and chestnuts were popular hair darkening agents,"" Hernandez says. You would pile the paste from the roots and nuts on top of your head, keep it in place with a string, and leave it to rot for two days, letting the color soak in.Remember the mouse hair eyebrows? Those weren't the only faux-hair options during the times. Women also liked to play around with hair extensions to give them more options with their locks, but, as you can imagine, the church had an issue with that. ""None to surprisingly, the clergy tried to discourage the wearing of false hair by women by denouncing false hair as the sin of vanity,"" Stella Mary Newton, author of Fashion in the Age of the Black Prince: A Study of the Years 1340-1365, explained in her book. ""Gilles d'Orleans, a preacher from Paris in the 13th century reminded his parishioners that the wigs they wore were likely to be made from the shorn heads of those now suffering in hell or purgatory."" That would definitely make some want to discreetly take the clips out of their heads.Skin was a big deal in the medieval ages — and not just because women strove to have the pale, glowing skin of the presiding Lady Regency. Having any freckles, moles, or birthmarks were thought of as stains of witchcraft: As marks left behind from sexy midnight entanglements with the devil. ""Any marks on the body were believed to be evidence of being different, and different meant evil in medieval times,"" Hernandez shares. Because of that, ointments and recipes to get rid of any and all marks were paramount.There were a lot of out-there recipes to fight freckles and blotches, but here are some of the more interesting ones. You could fill a wooden bowl full of the blood of a bull or hare and then apply it like a face mask, which had faint Evil Queen vibes. If you got squeamish at the sight of blood, an alternative was to gather willow tree water to fight any skin discoloration. In order for it to work, you had to wait until the tree flowered, and then slit the bark to gather the water. You then boiled it in wine and drank as much as you needed to. Or if you wanted to do something a little less witchy feeling, you could simply make oatmeal boiled with vinegar, and the unpleasant breakfast was to take away any freckles or spots on your body.If you wanted to whiten your face for fashionable — rather than save-your-life-because-you're-a-witch — purposes, then there were plenty of powder cosmetic recipes available. But they all had a common theme: Poisons.""White lead was a very popular lightening agent, used in creams and powders. All manner of acids were used to bleach the complexion, like lead and vinegar. Lotions and creams were widely sold to bleach the skin. Most contained mercury, lead, carbolic acid, and mercuric chloride,"" Hernandez says. Many of these were cut with flour, but after an extended period of use the woman would begin to become sick and disfigured from the ingredients.But that's not to say that some women didn't use those dangerous ingredients to their advantage. Enter the brand Aqua Toffana, who would intentionally add poison to their powder and sell it to wealthy women who wanted to kill their husbands to get full control of the family wealth. ""Aqua Toffana was a liquid preparation sold around 1650 that contained lead and arsenic. It was used by women to kill their husbands or other family members by poisoning their wine or food. If it was blended into powder, it would have also killed the wearer, since this poison can be absorbed by the skin,"" Hernandez explains. The woman would put it on her face, ask her husband to primly kiss her on the cheek, and slowly poison him with the cosmetic. Talk about the click of a compact case being sinister.Even if you didn't have an earl or duke you wanted to kill, being pale was very stylish. So much so that some women would take it up a level and make their skin look paper thin and translucent with the help of blue ink. ""The drawing of blue veins onto the skin was a common practice back then since the dresses of the time exposed the chest and bosom. They would whiten the complexion with powders and then draw the veins to make the skin look like it was translucent and pale, so you could see through it. It seemed delicate and ethereal to have translucent skin,"" says Hernandez. We have contouring and strobing today, and they had vein painting then.The church at the time was very afraid of the naked body and all its temptations, so much so that it urged its followers to avoid bathing in order to keep living a pious life. Since it became common practice to go without soap for months at a time, people had to find clever work-arounds to keep their body pong at bay.""The wide use of perfumes and aromatic spices is due to the fact that people did not bathe very often in the past. They would use pomanders, or dried oranges stabbed with cloves, to hang on the dress skirts to keep odors at bay,"" Hernandez explains. ""Fragrant spice sachets would be tucked in several places in the body, in the bosom, under arms and skirts. There were even extra cloth pieces that could be removed once they were soaked with sweat under the armpits of fancy ball gowns."" Just because bathing wasn't an everyday occurrence didn't mean that women had to smell.From wearing opal necklaces to lighten hair to drinking the water of a flowering weeping willow to fight acne, there were a lot of interesting beauty tips in the Middle Ages. It's a good thing fads change yearly, or else we'd still be fighting freckles with bull's blood.Images: PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (2); Rogier van der Weyden, Portrait of a Lady, c. 1460 (1); Lady With A Unicorn - 1505 (1); Portrait of Anne Boleyn (1); Diane De Poitiers (1499 – 1566) by Jean Clouet (1); Portrait Of Lady Mary Fleming (1); Florentine School Portrait 1460-70 (1)Choose an edition:",7.1175,9.81,6.13,9.38,3.15,1892

But in the olden days, young girls spent sleepless nights in a bid to prepare the best possible cosmetics, while the modern girl has just to walk across the street to get things to change her face.
                               R V Smith | June 28, 2018 5:23 am  Mughal beauties : outing with king While there is so much adulation of Mughal monuments not much is said about how moon-faced Mughal woman adorned themselves to rule over a harem of thousands of ladies, even though true beauty does not need any aids, for it lies in the eye of the beholder.However, true beauty, like Plato’s Table, is an ideal sans definition, hence the need for beauty aids to gloss over blemishes. Our civilisation has come a long way now from those ancient days, when woman did not use cosmetics. They bathed in fountains and streams, ate a humble repast, clothed themselves in what was available and yet broke many hearts. This is not to suggest, however, that all of them were “La Belle Dame sans Merci”. Many of them had their hearts broken in turn by the gay gallants and pined away like the Lady of the Lake.But those ages waned and later we find girls in India, Egypt, China, Rome and Greece, perfecting the art of cosmetics. It was crude compared to modern methods but the purpose was the same. The axiom that “fairness hides a lot of sins”, made girls of a darker complexion use herbs and ointments to make their skin fairer. Gram flour, cream and oils were mainly employed for the purpose. In India there were 16 “shingars”, or modes of make-up, and so when Pakeezah sings her famous song, “Main tau kar aaun solah shingar re…”, she is giving vent to the Mughal days’ charms of beauty, which made the Indian bride shine like the harvest moon.Sandalwood paste, amla oil, kajal, surma, turmeric (haldi), clay bath and baths in the early morning with water cooled in the moonbeams were what kept girls of rich families occupied. They ate more than their modern counterparts but their diet was well-balanced and they were robust and full of life unlike some of the sickly specimens seen these days. Dr R Nath has devoted a whole chapter to medieval cosmetics in his book, The Private Life of the Mughals, and of how bride and groom were prepared for marriage.In the days of the Hindu kingdoms, the emphasis was on chastity and as such undisturbed beauty sleep was not the custom but one of the essentials of a good life. In the days of the Mughals and later the Nawabs of Lucknow, girls of good families were just as chaste as those earlier, but there were certain families, which practised the art of public idolatry of women. These women were not the fallen kind one finds in brothels.They were the pace-setters of the fashions of those days. The courtesans graced the courts of the nobles and not necessarily their cots. Intimacy was limited to the one who showered favours. Until he continued to do so there was no question of a rival. Those were the days when women used hot ash to pluck out unwanted hair and craned their necks to watch the kites sailing in the sky to develop a long swan-like neck or the proverbial goblet-shaped one. Lotus and honey were used as a hormone preparation to develop the body and Urad dal avoided like poison to cut down fat.But at about the same time in the West, Alexander Pope, a great observer of the social life of his times, had this to say about beauty aid employed by women:“And now unveiled, the Toilet stands displays. Each silver Vase is mystic order laid. First robed in white, the nymph intent adores with head uncovered, the Cosmetic powers. Unnumberd treasures ope at once, and here.This casket India’s glowing gems unlocks. And all Arabia breathes from yonder box. The Tortoise here and Elephants unite, Transformed to combs the speckled and the white. Here files of pins extend their shining rows, puffs, powders, Patches, Bibles, Billetdoux… The best sylphs surround their darling care, These set the head, and those divide the hair…”Now, with sprays, dyes, wigs, eyebrow pencils, bindis, nail polishes, lipsticks, shampoos and powders, the whole perfumery of the East and West produce glamour girls, who with the aid of anklets, trinklets, bracelets, bangles, girdles, necklaces, eye-shadows, and tight or loose, high or low cut clothes, wrench out the heart of the most cynical of youths.Boutiques, first popularized by Yves St Laurent, Christian Dior and Givenchy, cater to the needs of the most ordinary of women and convert them overnight into Cinderellas pursued by the princeliest of men.In the olden days, when young girls spent sleepless nights in a bid to keep the diva burning with spices and oils of many kinds to produce the best kajal possible, or the milk in the earthenware pot from curdling, and applying the cream used for complexions, the modern girl has just to walk across the street to get things which can change her face in a trice.Mehndi, or henna, for the hands, lipsticks of a hundred hues to redden lips, topees and clothes for hair-dos, “kasturi” and “manjans”, “datoons” and toothpastes for pearly teeth are all readily available.The story of the man who discovered on his wedding night that the buxom wench he had married was but an old, bald woman with artificial teeth and hair and padded breasts and hips, is perhaps no exaggeration for it speaks a world of truth for the concept of beauty through cosmetics and beauty aids.Thus Milady walks or struts about the street in borrowed beauty, the cynosure of all eyes and the butt of many a joke, according to the whim of the passerby, who little knows what a bewildering variety of cosmetics has converted plain Jane into an Ursulla Andress or a Bridget Bardott.

77,https://www.gqindia.com/content/how-to-lose-weight-in-15-days-with-5-simple-tips-backed-by-science,"Follow usBy GQ StaffThe answer to how to lose weight lies in planning your meals right. Losing weight need not be synonymous with giving up everything you love. It is, really, just a matter of following a good diet plan that doesn't just provide nutrition to your body but also helps to stay away from those hunger pangs that drive you to the refrigerator. These weight-loss tips are backed by science and, really, quite easy to follow. This is how you can lose weight in 15 days:Any weight-loss plan that demands a crash diet won't work for you in the long run. While you may lose weight initially, the crash diet will not only deplete your energy levels but also make it difficult for you to sustain the diet plan. A crash diet also negatively impacts your metabolism so to get the most of your diet, you need to:Reduce your appetite slowly but in a healthy wayCut down your current weight without starvingImprove your overall metabolismHere is a step-by-step guide on how you can lose a significant amount of weight in 15 days.This is the easiest way to kick off your body's metabolism. Start your day with a glass of warm water with a tablespoon of honey and lemon juice. What this concoction does is this: The warm water increases the temperature of your body, which in turn improves your metabolism rate. Higher the metabolism, easier it is for your body to burn calories. The honey will help you cut down the fat and gives you that much-needed energy boost soon after you've woken up. If you'd paid attention to your biology class in school you'd probably remember that lemons are rich in Vitamin C, which can help to break down your body fat when you exercise. If lemon doesn't excite you, stir in a pinch each of dry ginger powder,  cinnamon powder, turmeric powder, black pepper powder and fennel seeds powder in a glass of warm water. Cinnamon will help  reduce the fat that gets stored in your body, dry ginger helps reduces the urge to overeat and improves pancreatic activity and production of bile salts and thereby helping your body store less fat. Black pepper is known to aid metabolism and digestion and this in turn will speed up the breakdown of fat cells. Turmeric is known for its healing powers but did you know it also contains curcumin which is known to metabolize the fat in your body. And finally, fennel seeds act as a diuretic and produce more urine, thereby helping to flush out toxins and decreasing the amount of fluid in your body.How often has your diet plan gone down the drain when, in a moment of weakness, you reached out to the tub of ice-cream in the refrigerator? The best way to stay on course is to simply get rid of all the junk food in your house. If you want to make the most of your 15-day weight loss plan, you need to clear out your fridge and throw out all the packaged and processed foods in your house. Love aerated drinks? Great! Throw them out too. Processed foods almost always contain some form of refined fructose, which makes your body absorb and store more calories and fat. This makes it difficult for your body to lose weight. Drinking aerated drinks over a period of time, even the diet variety, can stop you from losing weight, as they contain high amounts of calories, sugar and artificial sweeteners that deplete your body's reserves of calcium, magnesium and vitamin A, all of which are important for a healthy and safe weight loss.As you probably know, not all fats are bad. Healthy fats, or unsaturated fats, will not just help you lower your cholesterol levels but also control your hunger pangs and reduce the total amount of calories you consume. These fats -- found in fatty fish, chia seeds, nuts, olive oil, avocados, almonds, coconut and whole eggs -- will also help improve your rate of metabolism.There are several researches that have pointed to the wisdom of having your final meal of the day before 7 pm. People who don't dine or eat any kind of snack after sunset tend not to gain weight as easily as people who do. When you eat your last meal of the day before 7 pm, it will help your body burn more calories and thus help you lose weight faster. This is also, by the way, the precondition for going to bed early. Having dinner at 7 pm won't help if you're going to be up till midnight. That will trigger midnight hunger pangs.To get the best results from your weight-loss plan, some very basic and light workouts will always help accelerate your weight loss. It is important to eat the right type of foods when you are on a quick and healthy weight loss mission, as it will give your body the energy it requires and also keep you hydrated, all of which will enable you to perform better and help you lose weight faster.Cut down on all forms of sugar, especially from your coffee and tea. Avoid snacking.Consume more high protein foods in your breakfast.Drink a glass of water at least half an hour before your meal and another glass between your meals to control your hunger and avoid overeating.Chew your food properly to help your body digest them easily and improve metabolism.Reducing weight does not mean you can never have a cheat day. As this is a weight loss plan that is intended to help you lose weight in a very short amount of time, follow the tips as much as you can.

Do you want to get back in perfect shape before a family function or a vacation that you have been dreaming about for long? Then this lose weight in 15 days guide is certainly going to be of great help for you.A lot has been said about weight loss diets which claim to help you lose weight quickly, but their effectiveness has always remained under scrutiny. When you consider their side effects and the nutritional deficiency which they cause to your body, you realise that you have been cheated again with nothing but fake promises. However, many dietitians and nutritionists have explained that a person can easily lose around 2-3 kgs of weight in a healthy way in 15 days. Some even say that if you follow a healthy diet and exercise routine only for a stipulated frame of time without being too strenuous on your body or fasting unto death, you can easily lose weight in 15 days. Lose Weight In 15 Days – Is That PossibleYes, it is if you continue to take a high protein, moderate carbohydrate, and low-fat diet for 15 days you can lose weight effectively. While protein is the prime ingredient for weight loss, carbohydrates are essential for fueling the brain and low-fat diet fulfills fatty acids requirement of the body, which are necessary for performing various metabolic processes. For losing weight effectively in 15 days diet plan, you must start with a detox day followed by a high protein diet. This will go on for 15 days wherein one day will be detox diet and second will be your high protein diet day.Below a sample 1 day detox diet and a 1-day high protein diet chart is provided for your reference. Detox Diet Plan
 High Protein Diet Plan How To Deal With Food Cravings It is common and obvious for people to crave for sweet, starchy and salty foods when following a strict diet for weight loss. In such cases, one can rely on fresh fruits and handful of dry fruits to control their untimely cravings. Gorging on your favorite ice cream or a pack of chips that you have been eyeing for long, is only going to spoil your weight loss regimen. Another helpful way to avoid untimely binge is to divert your mind. Read a book, doodle something, listen to music, do whatever you like to keep your mind off from the thoughts of food. Exercise For 15 Days Weight Loss PlanNo weight plan is considered complete without the inclusion of some sort of physical activity. A successful weight loss diet plan consists 80% diet and 20% exercise. As you are aiming for weight loss in 15 days you need to focus on full body exercises rather than focusing on any single body part. 45 to 60 minutes cardio session daily is enough to facilitate your 15 days weight loss diet plan. Some cardio exercises that you can consider including in your plan are:For faster results, you can combine your cardio with weight training. This will help in burning calories at a higher rate and will also improve your metabolism.15 Days Weight Loss Diet Plan – Things To Consider Apart from your diet and exercise, there are a few aspects you need to consider while taking up a plan to lose weight in 15 days:Monitor Your Water Intake: Water and weight loss is a magical concoction. It also works amazingly for maintaining an overall good health. You must aim to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water every day in addition to your diet and exercise regimen. Keep Stress At Bay: Most people gain weight when they are stressed out. Stress releases various hormones in the body that can hinder your weight loss goals. Indulge yourself in meditation and yoga for at least 15 to 20 minutes every day. This will keep your mind and body relaxed. Don’t Compromise On Sleep: A successful and healthy weight loss plan remains incomplete without essential 6 to 8 hours of sleep every day. A sound sleep keeps your mind refreshed and body energetic throughout the day. Be Medically Fit: Your blood chemistry with hormones that control thyroid, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B12 should be completely insync before you get on the 15-day weight loss diet plan. If these blood levels are not in the normal range, the diet will affect your health and body adversely. If you keep these simple tips and tricks in mind while following the shared sample diet plan you can easily lose weight in 15 days. Do not forget to track down your progress after 15 days and ensure that you are yielding effective outcomes in quick time.

82,https://www.healthifyme.com/blog/best-indian-diet-plan-weight-loss/,"Are you looking for the best Indian diet plan to lose weight? The rules are simple. All you need to do is start eating right. But in India, this can feel like an insurmountable challenge, given our food culture and dietary habits. For instance, a typical Indian meal is high in carbohydrates and sugar – we eat a lot of potatoes, rice and sweets. We also love our snacks and can’t imagine a day without our fix of namkeens and bhujias. We pressurize our friends and family into eating too much, as a sign of hospitality and affection, and consider refusing an extra helping a rebuff. To top it all, we’ve never embraced physical exercise as essential. It’s no wonder that India is battling a growing obesity problem.But the answer doesn’t lie in shunning Indian food in favour of foreign ingredients or fad diets. You’ll find that the best Indian diet plan consists of foods you’ve already got in your kitchen and that you can lose weight by making a few changes to your diet.Weight loss and gain, revolve around caloric consumption and expenditure. You lose weight when you consume fewer calories than you expend. Conversely, you gain weight when you consume more calories than you expend. To drop those excess kilos, all you need to do is eat within your calorie budget and burn the required number of calories. A combination of the two works best suggest experts. Get your daily requirement of calorie consumption and burn based on your lifestyle and dietary preferences, by signing up on HealthifyMe.However, simply determining how many calories your body needs isn’t enough. After all, four samosas (600 calories), two slices of pizza (500 calories) and two gulab jamuns (385 calories) may be within your daily requirement of 1500 calories, but these unhealthy food choices will eventually lead to other health problems like high cholesterol and blood sugar. To lose weight the healthy way, you also need to ensure your diet is balanced i.e. it covers all food groups and provides all the nutrients you need necessary for good health.No single food provides all the calories and nutrients the body needs to stay healthy. That’s why a balanced diet comprising of macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein and fat along with micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, is recommended.The best Indian diet for weight loss is a combination of the five major food groups – fruits and vegetables, cereals and pulses, meat and dairy products, and fats and oils. Knowing how to divvy up the food groups, allocate portion sizes, and the best/ideal time to eat is also important.A lot can be spoken about what goes into an ideal diet chart. However, one’s nutritional requirement varies based on various factors. It could change depending on gender, for example, male dietary requirements vary from that of a female. Geography can play a role as well, with North Indian diets being largely different from South Indian ones. Meal preferences come into play since the consumption of food by a vegetarian or a vegan differing largely from that by a non-vegetarian.However, we have put together a diet plan for weight loss with Indian food. This 7 day diet plan, 1200 calorie diet plan is a sample, and should not be followed by any individual without consulting with a nutritionist.Mixed Nuts(25 grams)Roti (1 roti/chapati)Roti (1 roti/chapati)Green Chutney(2 tablespoon)Green Chutney(2 tablespoon)Egg Omelette(1 serve(one egg))Roti (1 roti/chapati)Roti (1 roti/chapati)Roti (1 roti/chapati)Roti (1 roti/chapati)While creating a diet chart, it is important to make sure it is balanced, in order to ensure that you receive all the required nutrients. Include the following nutrients in your diet plan:Carbs are the body’s main source of energy and should make up half of your daily calorie requirement. However, it’s important to choose the right type of carbs. Simple carbs, such as bread, biscuit, white rice and wheat flour, contain too much sugar and are bad for you. Instead, opt for complex carbs that are high in fiber and packed with nutrients as compared to simple carbs. Fiber-rich complex carbs are slow to digest, leave you feeling full for longer, and are therefore the best option for weight control. Brown rice, millets such as ragi and oats are all good complex carb choices.Most Indians fail to meet their daily protein requirement. This is troublesome, as proteins are essential to help paper writer the body build and repair tissue, muscles, cartilage and skin, as well as pump blood. A high protein diet can also help you lose weight, as it helps build muscle – which burns more calories than fat.About 30% of your diet should consist of protein in the form of whole dals, paneer, chana, milk, leafy greens, eggs, white meat or sprouts. Having one helping of protein with every meal is essential.A food group that has acquired a bad reputation, fats are essential for the body as they synthesize hormones, store vitamins and provide energy. Experts suggest one-fifth or 20% of your diet comprise of healthy fats – polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and Omega-3 fatty acids. Using a combination of oils for different meals – including olive oil, rice bran oil, mustard oil, soya bean, sesame, sunflower and groundnut oil – along with restricted quantities of butter and ghee is the most optimal way to consume fats. Avoid trans fats – that are found in fried snacks, completely.Vitamin A, E, B12, D, calcium and iron are essential for the body as they support metabolism, nerve and muscle function, bone maintenance, and cell production.

A good night’s rest has never been more important than the weeks (and days!) leading up to your wedding day. Not only are a solid eight hours of snooze crucial for your well being, but your skin can reap some overnight skincare benefits, too. Need another excuse to get in the habit of hitting the pillow at a reasonable time? You can maximize your skincare regimen with a bevy of treatments and hacks to get gorgeous skin while your body rests.

We enlisted the help of a couple of dermatologists and a celebrity facialist to get the secrets for achieving your best skin yet.

It starts with the basics, and the foundation of great skin is cleansed skin. “Wash your face with a cream-to-oil cleanser,” says Dr. Lily Talakoub of McLean Dermatology and Skincare Center. “Exfoliating cleansers can strip the natural barrier of the skin, leaving skin dry and dull. An oil-based or cream-to-oil cleanser is gentle on the skin and leaves the skin's natural barrier unharmed and glowing.” She recommends Comfort Zone Remedy Cream to Oil Cleanser.

Believe it or not, one kitchen essential can gently exfoliate the most sensitive or breakout-prone skin without the need for harsh scrubbing or a chemical-laden peel. Celebrity Facialist Joanna Vargas explains, “Raw apple cider vinegar is perfect for any skin type and particularly amazing for people who break out. It exfoliates, balances the skin, and it also helps calm breakouts and heals them quickly.” Vargas suggests applying a small amount all over your face like you would toner using a cotton round.
Vargas adds, “It’s not acidic, so it’s very gentle. Leave it on the skin as an overnight treatment, and it will make your skin look better in the morning—I would just warn people that the smell is not for everyone!”
Not only do they make for a great Instagram selfie, but sheet masks are great for hydrating skin. So, before you layer on your skincare products for the evening, Dr. Kenneth Howe of Wexler Dermatology suggests indulging skin with a heaping dose of extra moisture. “My favorite is the SK-II Facial Treatment Mask, which contains Pitera,” he says. “Derived from the yeasts involved in the fermentation of sake, Pitera is very similar to the natural moisturizing factors of our skin. It enables our skin to better hold on to moisture.” The result? “A more glowing, dewy appearance,” he says.

This is especially true on the nights leading up to the big day, Dr. Howe tells us. “If we’re talking about the actual night before the wedding, it can be helpful to avoid highly salty foods as they can lead to puffiness.” He also explains that puffiness under the eyes especially can lead to a tired look. “A de-puffing gel can help take down the swelling. A product such as Wexler Fastscription De-Puff Eye Gel actually works quickly,” he tells us.

If you’re still on the fence about facial oils, consider this more reason to take the leap. “Oils protect the outer layer of the skin and provide rich antioxidants to prevent against DNA damage,” explains Dr. Talakoub. She suggests layering an oil under your night cream for optimal results. “Choose [an oil] that is non-comedogenic. My favorites are ones with argan oil, sunflower seed oil, or marula oil.”

﻿One of the keys to achieving radiant skin is good old vitamin C. The super ingredient banishes dark spots and improves skin tone, revealing beautifully glowy skin—and who doesn’t want that? Dr. Talakoub reminds us to apply and massage around the eye area for a double dose of great skin. “Apply a brightening eye cream with vitamin C or licorice root extract from your temples to the inner corners of your eyes,"" she says. ""The vitamin C brightens dark under-eye circles while the outward massage helps improve lymphatic drainage, decreasing morning under-eye puffiness.""

And for others who have been neglecting a proper skin care regime also notice patchy and discoloured, dull looking skin. Coming to people with oily and combination skin types, the skin starts to look better, more porcelain and glowing, but remember even these skin types will feel a tightening and stretching of the skin and will require not just moisturising but nourishing too. So what's the difference between moisturising and nourishing you'd ask? The simplest way to explain it to you would be comparing a dehydrated powdered soup available in packets as against a fresh, wholesome, home-made soup. You can never replace the goodness of pure fresh ingredients and products whether it is on your skin and hair or something you take internally.So what are these winter skin nourishers that give you the goodness of natural ingredients? Do they just moisturise the skin or do they nourish and pamper it too? Most certainly the answer is in the affirmative. Let's have a look at some of nature's wonderful skin nourishers and see how you can use them to improve, soften, nourish and pamper your skin.Natural Skin Nourishers 1. HoneyHoney when taken internally and externally is excellent for the skin. For combination to dry skin types, take one teaspoon of honey and massage on the skin daily. Leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wash. Pat dry and you will see that not only is your skin softer but also glowing. Make sure you use raw honey both internally and externally in order to reap maximum benefits. Organic raw honey is easily available everywhere nowadays. (Also Read: 7 Easy Home Remedies To Get Rid Of Dandruff)Honey is excellent for hair. 2. FigsIt is one of my all-time favourites. Take two figs (anjeer) and mash them. Mix in with a little milk and gentle rub on the face for one to two minutes. Wash the face with water and pat dry. This remedy will help remove all the toxins on your skin and help it glow better. the mildly abrasive nature of figs help keep the skin healthy. Make sure you use this face pack regularly to reap maximum benefits. Make sure it suits your skin. Try a sample of this pack on your hand and see if it does not react. 3. MilkI personally love this ingredient. Not only does it softens and nourishes the skin but also makes it sensuous and helps in de-tanning. Wipe your skin with full fat milk twice a day or just splash a small bowlful of cold milk on your skin and pat dry. Milk is known to be one of the best moisturisers for your skin. This one's a great home remedy for those who have a dry skin. Ensure that you apply it regularly. 4. AvocadoThe healthy fruit with aphrodisiac properties works wonders for dry skin. Mash an avocado and apply it onto a clean skin, slowly massaging it. Leave it on for a minimum of 15 minutes before you wash off with milk and then water. Full of healthy fats, vitamins and antioxidants, avocadoes are great for your skin health. Using avocado oil is also one of the best options to keep your skin healthy. Eating avocadoes is also one way to help your skin glow.  5. BananaA common man's moisturiser and nourisher, never underestimate this fruit. Mash a ripe banana and massage the skin with the pulp. Even the driest of skins will thank you for it. Banana contains moisture, potassium and vitamins E and C, which are responsible for promoting clear skin. Use a ripe banana as it has more beneficial effects that unripe one.  (Also Read: 5 Natural Home Remedies To Get Rid Of Dark Circles)6. AlmondWhether you are using pure almond oil or almond paste, both are excellent sources of Vitamin E, providing nourishment for your skin externally. For dehydrated and dry skin, first massage the face with one teaspoon almond oil and then make a paste of 10 almonds mixed with a little milk and scrub it gently onto the skin. Wash the face with milk and then water. Not only will this help patchy skin but will give the skin an youthful texture, something we are all in constant search of. 7. OlivesOlive is an excellent source of vitamins. Take three to four mashed olives and apply it onto the skin and let it dry. Wash off with cold water and pat dry. It will help restore the skin's natural pH. Olives or olive oil has long been known for their  health and skin benefits. Olive oil is packed with anti-ageing antioxidants and hydrating squalene, making it amazing for hair and skin health along with nails.  8. PapayaI am amazed at the goodness of this humble fruit and have used it time and time again on my skin in various treatments, and they have all given positive results. Take mashed papaya and massage it onto the skin for five minutes. Wash the skin with milk and then water and see how clarified and soft your skin feels in minutes. Papaya nourishes the skin; thanks to the presence of vitamin A and papain enzyme, it helps remove dead skin cells and inactive proteins, thus rejuvenating your skin. 9. SugarSugar is an excellent skin softener. For best results, mix the grains with either curd or fresh cream to bring back life to the driest of all skins. Take one teaspoon of shakkar and mix with one teaspoon of malai and gently massage onto the skin. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then wash with cold water. Sugar scrubs have long been used for their abrasive nature that helps exfoliate the skin and help it to glow.  Sugar is an excellent skin softener. 10. Aloe veraThis modest plant can be grown practically everywhere - gardens, pots, terraces, etc - and is an excellent rejuvenator for undernourished skin. Scrape out the gel from the leaf, mash it and massage onto the skin. Let it sit there for 10 minutes and wash the skin with cold water and pat dry. Your skin will be rejuvenated naturally. Aloe vera soothes your skin, especially in summers when it faces the sweltering heat.  Now that you have these precious natural nourishers, all you need to do is start using them and see how your skin comes back to life and becomes super soft in minutes. Natural skin care is effective and easy. Until next time, make your skin happy naturally.About the author:Suparna Trikha is a beauty expert based in New Delhi.

This can be achieved with the right lifestyle practices and skincare habits. Our team of dermatologists put together a few ways to get healthy and glowing skin.Highlights:Glowing skin has a smooth texture and hence, is able to reflect light to give your face a glow.To begin with, follow a skincare routine religiously using products that suit your skin. Try and avoid harsh chemicals, sulfates, parabens, phthalates, dyes and fragrances.Layer your skin beginning with the lightest product and ending with the thickest. Remove all your makeup before you doze off at the end of a day. Here’s an ideal skincare routine:A squeaky clean skin is the first step in any skincare routine for glowing skin. Cleansing helps your skin ward off dirt, excess oil, makeup residue and dead skin cells. It also prepares your skin for the remaining steps in your skincare routine.Include cleansing as part of your morning and night skincare ritual. Limit it to two times a day as over cleansing can strip off essential oils from your skin and can interfere with your skin’s natural pH.Our skin makes dead skin cells in the dermal layer. These move up to the surface and shed off. As we age, shedding these dead skin cells becomes a task for the skin. They do not shed on their own and require our intervention.Exfoliation is a process that helps you get rid of the dead skin cells. They come in chemical, physical and enzymatic forms. Use a facial scrub once a week to wash away the dead skin cells.Cleansing and scrubbing can leave your skin with a disturbed pH. Your skin’s natural pH is around 5-6 (slightly acidic). Cleansers and scrubs tend to make it slightly alkaline.Toner is a skin care product aimed at balancing your skin’s pH. Toners available in the market contain soothing ingredients like cucumber and aloe vera.Skin concerns like acne, dark patches, tan, fine lines, etc. are the biggest hindrance to glowing skin. Address your skin concerns using serums that contain active ingredients.Serums contain powerful ingredients that are targeted at your skin concern. There are several serums in the market, ranging from anti-aging serum to dark spot control serum and acne reduction serum. So what’s your next pick?Does moisturizing your skin feel like a chore? Think again! Lack of moisturization can trigger extremely dry or extremely oily skin. Both of these can cause a variety of skin concerns including acne.Moisturizing your skin helps in repairing the barrier of your skin and prevents water loss. Besides, moisturization offers your skin a slight shine. They come in different forms like creams, lotions, gels and serums suitable for different skin types.Sunscreen protects your skin from the harsh sun rays. Prolonged exposure to the sun can lead to dullness, dark patches, tanned skin, fine lines, wrinkles and even cancer in some cases. UV rays have the ability to mess with your skin’s smooth texture and can suck the glow out of your skin.Dr. Harish Koutam, chief dermatologist at SkinKraft, recommends wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the year irrespective of the season.Yoga, gym, Zumba, aerobics...whatever interests you, just go for it. Exercise helps you sweat it out and releases toxins from your body and skin. There is also improved blood circulation. What follows is healthier and glowing skin. Make sure you cleanse your face or take a shower post workout.Stress is one of the causes of a lot of skin concerns. Stress can lead to breakouts, fine lines and wrinkles. Keep stress at bay by practicing meditation and mindfulness.Remember the good old saying that goes, ‘you are what you eat’. This is absolutely true and will make sense once you switch to a healthy diet. If you eat fresh and healthy food, your skin will reciprocate the same, offering the glow you require. Some of the foods for glowing skin include:Your kitchen has a lot of ingredients that can restore your skin’s beauty and can offer radiant looking skin. Even though these home remedies are not scientifically proven, they are being used by people for a very long time to achieve glowing skin.Mix raw milk with rose water and apply it evenly on the face. Wash off with lukewarm water after 15 minutes.Mix besan (gram flour), turmeric, lemon and curd to form a thick paste. Apply it on the face and wash off after 20 minutes.Lemon can be used in combination with honey, sugar or coffee powder to help in exfoliating the skin.Blend potato juice with honey and apply it on your face. Wash it off after 15 minutes.You can use aloe vera gel alone or in combination with honey or lemon to get glowing skin instantly.You’ve heard it a million times. But we would like to repeat the importance of drinking water. Water forms the crux of your skin’s natural barrier. When there is water loss from this barrier, your skin is prone to damage.Drink 2-3 liters of water every day and see what wonders it can do to your skin. Your skin not only glows but is also soft and supple as it is hydrated.Adequate sleep assists in cell turnover and exfoliation. Remember to get 7-8 hours of sound sleep for glowing skin. Lack of sleep can result in puffy eyes and dark circles.Collagen is a skin protein that gives skin its strength. When you get enough sleep, collagen production is stimulated. This makes your skin look younger and plump.Tobacco accelerates the natural aging process, making you look older. Alcohol destroys the supply of vitamin A to your bloodstream. Vitamin A is important in collagen stimulation, which is necessary for the skin’s strength. In the absence of vitamin A, skin tends to age faster.Did you know that cigarette smoke contains 7000 chemicals and some of them are carcinogenic compounds (cancer-causing)? Smoking is also linked to psoriasis, a skin condition resulting in red, dry and patchy skin, uneven skin tone, discolored nails and staining.Now you know that you don't have to be born with glowing skin. All the above steps when followed regularly can get you closer to your dream of glowing skin. Have you got more to add?

95,https://yourstory.com/weekender/a-guide-to-a-healthy-mane-hair-care-tips-from-dermatologist,"falsetrueMany of today's common hair care practices are harmful to hair follicles. Because of the different types of processing that people are doing now, the types of alopecia we are seeing are different from what we were seeing 20 years ago. Modern hair growth tips would have you believe that popping a magic pill or slathering on endless hair care products are key to doubling the length of your tresses, but the reality is that only a healthy scalp can lay the basis for adequate, long-term hair growth. For healthy hair, it is very important to have proper nutrition, gentle shampoos and conditioners, avoid too much of heat styling, and many more. In this article, I am including all these hair care tips for your healthy, smooth, and shiny hair. The basic early recommendation is to ensure you're watching your diet, get enough iron, you're not anaemic, and that you have enough protein in your diet. Iron and protein are very important to the health of the hair. The best protein foods you can add to your diet are eggs, spinach, fatty fish, avocadoes, seed, soybeans, etc. Consuming more biotin has also been shown in studies to improve hair growth in people who are deficient in biotin. Spinach is also an excellent plant-based source of iron, which is required for hair growth. Iron assists red blood cells in transporting oxygen throughout the body to fuel metabolism and aid in growth and repair. Furthermore, avocados are high in vitamin E, which may help with hair growth. One medium avocado (about 200 grams) provides 21 percent of your daily vitamin E requirements.Tiny painful boils on the scalp are a sign of bacterial and fungal infection caused by excessive sweat and dirt on the scalp. A SLS and paraben-free shampoo should be used while leaving the shampoo 1-2 minutes prior to rinsing. Sulphate may be effective at removing oil and dirt, but it has also been linked to hair loss and thinning hair as it destroys hair follicles and inhibits hair growth. Argan oil is packed with fatty acids and strong antioxidants, like vitamin E, that have proven beneficial for the hair and the scalp. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of argan oil protected skin from free radical damage caused by the sun. This benefit may also extend to the hair, assisting in the prevention of drying and other damage caused by ultraviolet rays. To remove sweat from the scalp, use a cold blow dryer.How many times should you wash your hair depend on the amount of oil your scalp produces. Don't believe the myth about 100 brush strokes per day. Excessive brushing will cause hairs to fall out. Some hair loss is normal; most people lose 50 to 100 strands of hair per day. These have stopped growing and have entered a resting stage. Use a brush with ball-tipped bristles to avoid losing more hair than usual. Also, never brush wet hair; instead, use a comb. Curly hair is more prone to breaking and becoming dry and brittle. Using a pick gently rather than combing or brushing keeps curls looking better. Don't overuse flat irons and relaxers, which can cause hair damage.The best thing you can do for better hair days is nothing at all. All of the tugging, combing, brushing, drying, and chemically treating of hair harms the shafts. Take a break from styling if your hair is damaged. Breakage and frizz can also be caused by hair straightening and rebounding treatments. To achieve a groomed appearance, you can instead opt for a keratin treatment with a trained hairstylist.Ponytails and braids are excellent ways to express your individuality. But they can break hair and damage the roots if they're too tight. You can even make your hair fall out with a tight style around the clock. Every night, put your hair free! Give your hair a break after three months if you wear large extensions.Protect hair when swimming Wet and condition your hair before swimming to protect it from the harmful effects of chlorine. Even, after swimming, make sure to thoroughly shower with shampoo and deep conditioning to preserve the health of your hair.If you don't take care of your hair, it will stop growing after a certain point. Gradually, you can find dandruff, hair loss, dryness, and dullness. So, by using chemical-free products designed for your specific hair type, eating well, avoiding heat styling, and following all of the above tips, you can say goodbye to bad hair days.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",7.305,10,5.27,9.52,4.43,756

We’ve spoken to leading experts in the beauty industry for their seven, yes, just seven key hair rules to stick to for the happiest, healthiest hair of your life.Bye, bad hair days. Mintel reports that 33% of women who have changed their washing habits in the last 12 months cite worrying about damage as the top reason, so how often should you be shampooing? Well, industry experts argue that less is more.“Over-washing can be damaging for your hair, especially if it is bleached, coloured, has been chemically treated or is naturally very dry or porous,” says Steve Rowbottom, co-director of Westrow.“When you wash your hair every day it strips away the natural oils and proteins that you need to keep your hair and scalp healthy, so try to limit hair washing to three times a week if you can.”But it does depend on your hair type. The best shampoo for thick, coarse, curly hair“The curlier your hair is, the longer you can go between washes,” explains dermatologist Dr. Doris Day. If you have thick, coarse, curly hair, pick a shampoo that hydrates as it cleanses, like Percy & Reed’s Perfectly Perfecting Wonder Wash Shampoo, £18. It’s also sulphate-free, so won’t strip your colour.The best shampoo for fine hair“The finer and straighter your hair is, the faster the oil wicks down,” says Steve, “so that can make it oilier faster. If you have super straight hair, you may not be able to go more than two days without washing.” If you have fine, straight hair, pick a gentle shampoo like Bumble and Bumble’s Gentle Shampoo, £22.50 which is super-kind on strands. The best shampoo for coloured hairIf you colour your hair regularly then it’s best to avoid washing your hair every day to keep your colour from fading and your strands from becoming parched. The same applied for just-dyed lengths. “Leave your hair for at least 72 hours after a colour appointment before washing it again,” says Kamila Pruszek, salon manager at West London salon, Blue Tit. “It can take up to three days for the hair cuticle to fully close, trapping in the colour molecules. If you wash your hair before the cuticle has closed, you risk disrupting the freshly applied colour and your gorgeous new hue is likely to fade.” When you do eventually wash your hair, avoid shampoos that contain sulphates and silicones. Sulphates can strip the colour, while silicones leave behind residue that can leave your new colour looking dull. Stylist recommends Pureology’s Hydrate Colour Care Shampoo, £14.95, which cleanses from root to tip without stripping your strands of colour and Moroccanoil’s Hydrating Shampoo, £19.95, to eradicate build up and nourish porous lengths. The best shampoo for African or Caribbean hairAfro and Caribbean hair can get very dry because of its unique texture, which also makes it incredibly fragile. Most hairdressers comment that the issues they see with this type of hair are from a build-up of debris on the scalp and damage caused by detangling. KeraCare Hydrating Detangling Shampoo, £5.40, is specifically designed to put moisture and bonds back in your hair. Remember, dry shampoo is your friend“If you’re prone to greasy hair, then use a little dry shampoo in between washes to soak up excess oil,” advises Steve. “But try and avoid becoming too reliant on dry shampoo as it can cause build-up on the scalp and clog hair follicles, which can impede hair growth. If you really struggle to avoid frequent washing then remember that certain styles work better – and look better – on hair that isn’t freshly washed. Braids, bedhead buns and twisted topknots are all great looks for those in-between wash days.”Hair can be damaged by both UV and heated tools, like straighteners, tongs and even your trusty hairdryer, so it’s important to give your hair as much protection as possible.“When you dry your hair at home always use a heat protector,” says hairstylist Mark Woolley of Electric Hairdressing. Try the ghd Heat Protect Spray With UV Protection, £14.50, to condition from the inside out and shield against damage from straighteners and colour-zapping rays.And when drying, be sure not to hold the hair dryer too close to your lengths, to prevent split, fluffy ends. “As a test, blow the hairdryer onto your hand and see how fast you pull away when holding it close to your skin.” 3) Become a blow-dry proA good blow-dry should last at least a couple of days depending on your hair type, and there are several products that will help prolong the life of your style. You can also bypass hot tools by multitasking your hair style, as celebrity stylist Dan Sharp explains: “Styling doesn’t always have to involve a hot tool. If you give yourself a fierce blowout on Monday, rock it out on Tuesday and on Wednesday do a fab high ponytail. Making your style last a few days will really help prevent damage.”The perfect at-home blow-out is not as tricky as it sounds and if you invest in a few good tools it’ll make it even easier.“Start by flipping your head upside down, and shake your hair around while you blow-dry,” says hair care expert Harry Josh. “The more you move, the more volume you’ll get. Once it’s about 80 percent dry, flip back up and blow-dry hair in sections to smooth, focusing on polished ends. The last three inches are key: Move your brush and dryer right down to the very end of the strands and take your time. It will make all the difference. Most people come at their heads from the side, which makes hair frizzy and staticky by pushing it all over the place.”A good blow-dry should last at least a couple of days depending on your hair type, and there are several products that will help prolong the life of your style.

Making your style last a few days will really help prevent damage.”The perfect at-home blow-out is not as tricky as it sounds and if you invest in a few good tools it’ll make it even easier.“Start by flipping your head upside down, and shake your hair around while you blow-dry,” says hair care expert Harry Josh. “The more you move, the more volume you’ll get. Once it’s about 80 percent dry, flip back up and blow-dry hair in sections to smooth, focusing on polished ends. The last three inches are key: Move your brush and dryer right down to the very end of the strands and take your time. It will make all the difference. Most people come at their heads from the side, which makes hair frizzy and staticky by pushing it all over the place.”Think of your hair like your skin - what you put on it will affect it. Investing in good quality products and tools will keep hair looking and feeling healthy and strong. “People are cheap with what they use on hair but wouldn’t dream of treating their cashmere jumper in that way,” says hair stylist and Redken Ambassador Tracy Cunningham. “At home, you should have a round brush for blow-drying, a Mason Pearson brush for styling and a tail comb to move hair around a little,” says hair legend and Redken Global Creative Director, Guido Palau.Good brushes are worth investing in and although might have a heftier price tag than others, if they’re looked after they will last forever. Keep your brushes clean and free of dead hair, oil and product build-up by washing them in a mixture of baking soda and warm water once a month.Good conditioner is also crucial when it comes to any hair type but particularly thick, curly tresses.“For curly, highly textured hair, always deep condition,” says celebrity hair stylist Ted Gibson. “No two minute conditioners here. Deep conditioning involves using a conditioner that will add moisture and strength (protein) back to hair. You should use heat by either applying conditioner to hair while taking a shower and let it sit while showering or by covering the hair with a plastic cap and applying heat from an outside like a hair dryer.“I believe it’s important to use leave-in conditioners and also not to shampoo so often. Rinse it if you want to but don’t necessarily shampoo it.”We recommend Dizziak’s Deep Conditioner, £22. To make sure your hair really absorbs the conditioner, towel-dry hair after shampooing. Excess water will mean the conditioner won’t be able to penetrate the hair shaft and deliver the necessary moisture to keep hair looking healthy and shiny.  If you’re short on time, at least squeeze out excess water.  Where you apply it matters, too. “Conditioner only needs to go on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair,” says stylist Kerrie Urban. “Try not to put the conditioner on the roots as it will cause your scalp to get greasy faster.” It’s also a good idea to think ahead and anticipate situations where your hair might dry out.“While you exercise, you perspire, which means that your hair gets damp with sweat that can actually make it dry,” says LA-based hair stylist, Andy LeCompte. “Before you hit the gym (especially during the summer, but this works year-round too) wet your hair and add in some conditioner from the mid-lengths to the ends. Rinse out the conditioner post-workout and you’ll be left with shiny, hydrated hair.”No-one wants a matted mess for a mane, so brushing is always necessary, but don’t tear through your locks mindlessly. According to Guy, being too aggressive will only cause damage, and no-one wants to contend with fluffy, split ends.“For perfectly shiny, healthy and untangled hair, you should be brushing your hair twice a day,” suggests hairstylist Laura Superbi. “Once in the morning and once before going to bed, for about a minute each time.”So what’s the best technique? “Brushing from the roots causes damage – always brush from the bottom and work up,” advises hair stylist Tracey Cunningham, especially if you have long hair. And the tools you employ should change when your hair is wet to avoid snapping and static. “When your hair is soaking wet, it is weaker, fragile and more susceptible to breakage,” says hairstylist Nicky Clarke. We recommend WetBrush’s Original Detangler, £11.99.If you have fine hairPeople with fine hair need to be careful when it comes to anything containing an oil like argan, coconut, or olive. While incredibly hydrating these wonder ingredients can be too much for fine tresses. Too much and you’ll add weight to the hair making it heavy, flat and limp. Aloe oil is a great alternative as it’s far lighter and will nourish without leaving hair looking or feeling greasy.Try: Philip Kingsley Maximiser, £19If you have thick hairThicker hair needs more hydration than fine textured hair due to its wider diameter. It’s worth investing in products that are moisture balancing to meet the needs of the drier ends and newer roots. If you find your hair is prone to frizzing, choose lightweight smoothing products that will tame and not weigh your style down. If your hair is wavy or curly, a heavier cream or serum may be needed. Try: Kérastase Nutritive Bain Satin 2 Shampoo, £17.75If you have afro-hairWith its unique structure African-Caribbean hair is the most vulnerable to damage of all hair textures. It has specific processing, styling and grooming needs and needs products that are suited to it. Being curly this type tangles easily and a lot of breakage happens through pulling so it’s important to take extra care. Always start at the ends and work up to your roots with a wide-tooth comb.Try: Charlotte Mensah Manketti Hair Oil, £48If you have coarse or curly hairCoarse, curly hair can often get dehydrated as it’s harder for natural oils to travel down the shaft and coat the entire strand. Jojoba oil and Shea butter are perfect as they are similar to our own natural hair oils. This type of hair can be difficult to style if it’s been over-washed and become frizzy but don’t be tempted to reach for anything too silicone-heavy as it will dull your colour and end up causing even more frizz. A pre-shampoo treatment can work wonders on coarse hair giving ultimate shine and hydration.Try: Leonor Greyl L’Huile De Pre-Shampoo Treatment, £29.60If you have damaged hairThose with coloured hair should avoid shampoos containing sulphates and silicones as they will strip colour and leave behind a residue that will make your new colour look dull and flat.Try: Moroccanoil Restorative Hair Mask, £32.85Sign up for the latest news and must-read features from Stylist, so you don't miss out on the conversation.Images: Getty/ InstagramStylist Beauty TeamFrom honey blonde to cotton candy pink.Everything you need to know.According to a celebrity colourist.Expert advice from a hairstylist with fine hairBecause any old high street salon just won't doCopyright © 2010–2021 Stylist",6.8625,9.92,5.41,9.2,2.92,2240

How you wash your hair and the products you use can go a long way toward maintaining smooth, shiny hair. Follow these simple tips from dermatologists to maintain healthy hair.Wash oily hair more frequently. How often you wash your hair should be based on how much oil your scalp produces.

If your scalp is oily, you may need to wash it as often as once a day.Concentrate shampoo on the scalp. When washing your hair, concentrate on cleaning primarily the scalp, rather than washing the entire length of hair. Washing only your hair can create flyaway hair that is dull and coarse.Use conditioner after every shampoo unless you use a “2-in-1” shampoo, which cleans and conditions hair. Using a conditioner can significantly improve the look of damaged or weathered hair by increasing shine, decreasing static electricity, improving strength and offering some protection from harmful UV rays.Concentrate conditioner on the tips of the hair. Because conditioners can make fine hair look limp, they only should be used on the tips of the hair and not on the scalp or length of the hair.Choose a shampoo and conditioner formulated specifically for your hair type. For example, if you color your hair, use a shampoo designed for color-treated hair. If your hair is damaged or chemically treated, consider a “2-in-1” shampoo. Regardless of cost, many shampoo and conditioner brands provide the same benefits.Protect hair when swimming. Protect your hair from the damaging effects of chlorine by wetting and conditioning your hair before swimming. Wear a tight-fitting swim cap and use a specially formulated swimmers shampoo and deep conditioner after swimming to replace lost moisture.If you have questions about caring for your hair, you should make an appointment to see a board-certified dermatologist. 10 hair-care habits that can damage your hairTeaching your child healthy hair care habitsColoring and perming tips for healthier-looking hairAfrican-American hair: Tips for everyday care",6.64,10,4.06,9.3,3.2,616

Damaged hair with split ends inhibits the growth; thus benefits of trimming hair reduces the number of split ends which further helps in hair loss prevention.Once a hair strand splits, the damage will only increase.

The ends of your hair don’t affect the follicles in your scalp.Thus when you trim your hair it increases the hair growth and keeps hair more healthy.

However many experts says that too much brushing can cause breakage. Well, its true brushing your hair will help distribute natural oils from your scalp down the hair shaft thus helps in hair growth. But unfortunately brushing hair too much can damage your hair. Incorrect brushing and the wrong type of brush can also cause damage to your hair and scalp.Brushing stimulates blood flow to your scalp and provides essential nutrients to hair follicles creating healthier stronger strands. However, brushing gently is equally important as brushing vigorously can rip hair. If your hair is prone to hair fall, avoid brushing your hair when they are wet.

Blow drying your hair after a shower may seem to be an easy method but it could contribute to a lot of hair fall. Other than that we all have experienced those last-minute curling and ironing sessions before we run out for a party or dinner.The lack of times and our busy schedules push us to leave the hair tools on, leading to overheating.

Satin pillowcases are very smooth which means that your hair won’t get tangled up while sleeping on them.Those who love their cotton pillows won’t like it but yes they are not nearly as smooth as satin ones and their roughness creates friction between your hair and the surface of the pillow which in turn can lead to hair breakage.The scalp needs proper hydration regularly to be healthy and maintain an optimal environment for your hair follicles. If not properly hydrated the scalp became dry flaky itchy and can result in several other hair problems. Therefore just as you moisturise your face every time you wash your face, your hair needs to be conditioned with a deep hair conditioner every time too whenever you shampoo them with hair fall control shampoo.Whether your hair is straight, wavy, oily or dry, a weekly deep conditioning treatment is highly recommended. Conditioner strengthens the cuticle with a protective coating, allowing the hair to keep growing and not break easily.Most women wash their hair with shampoo and ignore the importance of a good conditioner. To put it simply, conditioner is a conditioning or moisturizing agent generally made up of ingredients such as silicones, oils, and emollients, as well as cationic surfactants.

A lustrous head of hair is indicative of a healthy life. Thus, hair care is one of the most important regimes that a person must consider.Taking care of hair is not too difficult. Simple practices such as oiling, shampooing and conditioning hair to keep the strands hydrated and the scalp nourished can work wonders on hair. Certain natural ingredients are also good to treat hair for an extra boost of conditioning.There are several easy-to-implement tips one can follow to achieve this. Using warm oil such as coconut, almond or olive oil to massage the scalp in circular motions helps to stimulate the flow of blood that leads to stronger hair. Sometimes, flyaway hair can ruin your entire appearance. Applying hairspray to the palm of your hand and then running that over your head can tame the flyaway hair and give you a smooth finish. Pouring water that is too hot onto the scalp can strip the hair of its natural oils thereby making it rough and dry. For hair that is shiny and reflective, a good tip is to rinse your hair at the end with beer or apple cider vinegar. This makes the hair appear glossier by locking shine into place. Environmental factors such as extreme weather, dirt, grime and pollution can seep the moisture out of hair, so it’s best to avoid it as much as possible. Ingredients like avocado, banana, yogurt, eggs, amla, reetha and shikakai are great to make hair masks in the comfort of your own home and at minimal expenditure. They deeply condition the hair and leave it hydrated and soft. Reduce frizz by sleeping on pillowcases that are made of satin as cotton pillowcases lead to greater generation of static that is responsible for making hair frizzy.Hair care does not necessarily mean the use of expensive products and pricey treatments in spas and salons. The philosophy with hair should generally be to keep it as clean as possible by washing it at least twice a week and to hydrate the hair and scalp with oils. Drinking plenty of water also has a positive impact on hair.ArabiaAustraliaBrasilBritainChinaCzechoslovakiaEspañaGermanyIndiaItaliaJapanKoreaMéxicoNederlandParisPolskaPortugalRussiaTaiwanThailandTürkiyeUkraineUS

We recommend you to incorporate foods such as fish, beans, soybeans, and vegetables into your daily diet. You should also include protein-rich sources, such as milk, peas, and lentils. Also, do not forget to drink plenty of water to flush out the toxins from your body.Since the old-golden days, our grandmothers made sure to apply healthy oil on our hair every day.

Try our Growth Volumizing Hair Growth Oil with all-natural ingredients and indulge in a relaxing pamper session twice a week.Brushing your hair after a shower is always a bad option.

   A shampoo with harsh ingredients (such as parabens and sulfates) can do more harm than good since it can strip your scalp of natural oils and make your hair drier. It is essential to choose good hair products for natural hair. However, if you have colour-treated or bleached hair, you need to use hair products that are specifically meant for coloured hair to protect it from fading. Washing your hair with a good shampoo is important but a conditioner is far more crucial to maintain the health of your hair. A conditioner can help add moisture to your hair and also give it a lot of shine. After washing your hair, you need to apply conditioner to the length of your hair and then rinse it after a few minutes. You are not supposed to apply conditioner to your scalp or roots.




  If you are not using natural hair care products, you can use simple things from your kitchen to condition your hair. Ripe bananas, honey, curd, avocados, oatmeal, etc. are excellent hair conditioners. All you need to do is to apply them to your hair for an hour and then wash it with a gentle shampoo. The first thing that you need to add to your normal hair care routine is an oil massage or a pre-shampooing routine, and this is irrespective of your hair type. You can use coconut oil, almond oil, olive oil, etc. to massage your scalp and hair. This will promote blood circulation and also add the much-needed moisture to your hair. Massage your hair with oil and then leave it for at least one hour or overnight before washing it with a gentle shampoo. Your hair will feel soft and look shiny instantly.




   There are plenty of hair oils available in the market that contain different herbs to promote hair growth, reduce hair fall, eliminate dandruff, etc. If you want to make your own herbal hair oil at home, you can easily find recipes on the internet to deal with all kinds of hair problems. In the past decade, many companies have launched leave-in hair conditioners, serums, dry oils, etc. These products have now become an important part of hair care routine for many people. One of the main reasons why many women have incorporated leave-in conditioners as a part of their hair care routine is because they help keep the hair manageable and soft.




   A leave-in conditioner helps to add moisture back to the hair and forms a protective coating on hair strands to avoid damage from the sun rays and pollution. There are plenty of leave-in conditioners that contain fragrance to make your hair smell good. Choose an alcohol-free formula to ensure that the product does not dry out your hair.[Also read: Steps To Wash Your Hair The Right Way! (Dos And Don’ts Included)] Just a simple hair care routine of shampoo, conditioner, oil massage and leave-in conditioner is not going to be enough if you want to keep your hair in the best possible condition. You need to give it special attention ever so often to keep it from getting dry, especially if you heat style or colour your hair frequently. [Also Read: How To Blow Dry Hair At Home][Also Read: Hair Colour Chart for Indian Skin Tones] You can add special hair treatments such as hair spa to your hair care routine. One of the benefits of hair spa is that it deep conditions the hair and reverses the hair damage caused by styling tools and harsh chemicals on the hair. You can book a salon at home from UrbanClap for a hair spa or do it at home by using deeply nourishing hair care products available at salons. Many people who know how to take care of hair naturally love to use homemade hair masks with ingredients easily available in the kitchen. You can check the recipes on the internet and get a hair spa at home. Related Articles5 Tips to Make Your Hair Colour Last Longer7 Hair Care Myths Busted!Steps To Wash Your Hair The Right Way!

(USA Only)Your cart is emptyMYSTERY PRODUCTAdd a Mystery Product and we'll include one full-size item for beard, hair, or body with >40% savings. How's that for awesome?ADD · $15There’s no question that a man’s hair is an important part of his overall look. There’s so much to consider – style, length, when to cut it, what products to use – that it can be overwhelming at times.We’re here to help, however, with our hair care tips for men. We’ll cover everything from how to take care of hair daily, to how to improve hair quality, and what to do (and not do) when you’re letting your hair grow out.In the end, we think you’ll have enough knowledge to make your daily hair care routine more effective than ever.If you’re like a lot of men, you step out of the shower after washing and/or conditioning your hair and rub it vigorously with a towel to help dry it. Don’t do it.The fact is, your hair is very susceptible to damage when it’s wet, and rubbing wet hair with a towel causes some of the hair to become caught in the threads of the towel and stretches hairs past their breaking point. In turn, this causes damage to the outer layers of hair, as well as split ends and frizziness.Instead, pat dry your hair after you shake out excess water while gently stroking it in the direction it grows.You also need to take caution when blow drying your hair. Honestly, the best way to dry your hair is to air-dry it, but blow drying may be your best option on those days when you’re running short on time. Some important things to remember when using a hair dryer are to use the lowest heat settings possible, and to always leave your hair slightly damp to make sure you aren’t over-drying it.We just talked about using a lower heat setting if you have to blow dry your hair, cutting down on any heat is a general rule for the typical men’s hair care routine.There’s nothing like a hot shower, especially when the temperatures outside dip below freezing, but hot water wreaks havoc on your hair because it strips much of the essential oils from your hair and scalp, which leads to dryness.Again, the best way to dry your hair is to let it air dry. If you use a hairdryer, cut back on the heat, and leave your hair slightly damp so you won’t be tempted to over dry it.Sometimes you just want to rock a hat or a cap but don’t overdo it. Tight hats can cause hair damage and loss because they pull too hard on the hair’s roots. Wear loose-fitting hats if possible.OK, so your hair is thinning on top while you still have a fair amount of it on the sides. Please don’t make the awful decision to cover the bare spots on top of your head with a comb-over. It’s never a good look and may remind people of the creepy uncle that keeps showing up at their family reunions. And most women will run – make that sprint – from a man with a comb-over. Do yourself a favor and get a haircut that suits your thinning style instead.Hopefully these tips will help you achieve the look you want in a hairstyle but, most importantly, help you to keep your hair as healthy as possible. Like anything else, strong, healthy hair is achieved through consistent effort and the right knowledge.There’s nothing wrong with using hair gels, waxes, and even hairspray for getting the style and look that you want. But, using too much product can make your hair look unnatural and heavy, so use only the amount that you really need instead of applying excess amounts.Here’s a quick primer on hair products that can help you make the right choices for your hair type:One of the great myths about washing your hair is that you need to shampoo it, rinse it, and then repeat the process once more. Not only is a double-wash unnecessary, but it may also dry out your hair.Deciding to let your hair grow long is not much different than deciding to grow a full beard, i.e., you need time, patience, and an idea of what you want. Let’s break it down and take a closer look; you’ll also want to check out our video to gain a better understanding of what we’re talking about.Take an honest look at the reasons and your goals for growing long hair. It’s a commitment, as well as something that needs to fit in with your lifestyle. You also need to make sure you have the extra time for your grooming routine, because longer hair requires a bit more time to maintain than shorter hair.One of the best things you can do while growing long hair is to own it. By that, we mean stay committed to the process, even when your hair looks bad when it’s growing out. There are going to be mornings when you wake up and, no matter what you do, it looks bad. It’s much easier to “train” shorter hair, but with longer hair you need to endure those moments of annoyance when your hair is at different lengths.It’s a lot like growing a beard. There will be moments in the process when you want to shave it off because of how it looks, but staying on track through the tough times truly pays off in the end. How long should you let it grow? Ideally, if you truly want long hair, you should give your hair about a year’s worth of growth before deciding your next move. Your hair will go through a lot of phases along the way, so be patient.When you’re growing your hair out it’s like a new look every month and the ability to train it completely vanishes, as we discuss in our Growing Out Your Hair video.Not that it’s always a hassle, because one of the beauties of growing your hair out is that there a lot of things you can try out – like ponytails – and play around with during the process.Investing in good tools is important whether you’re working on a car, doing a DIY project around the house, or when you’re taking care of your hair during the growing process. A wide-tooth comb is a good tool to have for hair care, as is a hairbrush with natural bristles. If you’re going the ponytail route, buy cloth-coated bands to hold things in place because they’re gentler on hair.That $3 bottle of shampoo from your local drugstore is fine for when you have short hair or a buzz cut, although, we still recommend using higher quality stuff. But any damage caused by cheaper shampoo when you have short hair is lessened by the fact that you’re going to cut your hair in a few weeks, anyway.On the other hand, using shampoo of lesser quality, one that’s less gentle on the hair, isn’t the best idea if you have long hair or are in the process of growing it out. Cheaper shampoos will cause split ends, frizziness, and dry out your hair because they’ll strip it of sebum – the natural oils from your scalp.It’s also important to find a shampoo that’s right for your type of hair, whether it’s oily, dry, or somewhere in between. If you’re not sure, don’t hesitate to ask your barber or stylist.Another helpful tool for many men is hair oil, which helps prevent dryness. Just work a little bit into your hair at the roots and distribute it evenly over your scalp. A word of caution about oil, however. Make sure that you read the label carefully to see that it consists of all-natural ingredients. Some companies use non-natural ingredients such as silicone that may damage your hair. But, overall, hair oil is an excellent tool to have in your grooming kit if you have dry or frizzy hair.After you’ve found the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair type, it’s time to wash your hair. It’s a good idea to use a wide-toothed comb to get rid of any tangles before you step in the shower and also when you hop out of the shower. Wet your hair with warm – not hot – water and then work the shampoo into your hair gently for a couple of minutes, then rinse. Next, apply your conditioner, which you also leave in for a couple of minutes before (ideally) rinsing it out with cool water.There’s plenty of debate about how often you should wash your hair. One school of thought says daily washing will eventually dry out your hair, but you’ll want to wash your hair more frequently when you’re growing it out. In any case, you may want to scale back a bit regarding how often you wash your hair, and always use gentler shampoos.We already touched a bit on drying your hair and the same basic rules apply to long hair as they do to all lengths and types of hair: 1) rubbing your hair with a towel to dry it makes it susceptible to damage; 2) pat dry or air dry your hair instead; 3) be careful of overdoing it with a hairdryer, so keep the heat lower and your hair should be slightly damp when you finish.We all know how excessive exposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays can damage skin, but it can damage your hair, as well. The good news is that there’s a variety of hair products designed to protect your hair from the sun, including shampoos and conditioners.The chlorine found in swimming pools can easily dry out your hair and cause it to become brittle. But you can protect your hair by wetting it first – with regular water, that is – and then apply a mild conditioner before you take a refreshing dip.It’s extremely important to know your scalp type before you buy hair products such as shampoo and conditioner.Nothing too complicated here; if your hair often feels oily or greasy then you have an oily scalp. Chances are you’ve tried a variety of shampoos to cut down on the greasiness, but some things to keep in mind when you’re considering your purchase include avoiding shampoos that are labeled as moisturizing or hydrating while choosing those that are called “strengthening,” “balancing,” or “daily clarifying.” You should also make sure that you work your shampoo deeply into your scalp to help break up excess oils.A dry scalp is the type that often feels dry and itchy, and plagued by dandruff. But there are varying degrees of a dry scalp and you should buy shampoos and conditioners accordingly. If you have minor dryness, a shampoo that promotes moisture and hydration will help.If your scalp is extremely dry, then it’s a good idea to look for ingredients, such as tea tree oil, that have extensive moisturizing properties. Shampoos that you don’t want to purchase if you have a dry scalp are those called ‘strengthening’, ‘fortifying’, or ‘volumizing’ on their label.Good for you if you have a normal scalp. That means your hair is generally easy to manage, has the right amount of oil, and that you don’t have to over-complicate things when shopping for products. Your primary mission is to find a shampoo that has a balance between moisturizing and cleaning.Many of our hair care tips apply to all men, regardless of race. But African-American men need to follow a slightly different routine to keep their hair healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips to follow:Perhaps the biggest reason to shampoo less is because of a chemical called sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) found in most off-the-shelf shampoos. SLS strips away your scalp’s natural oils – oils that help protect your hair. The result is hair that’s dry and brittle.Many experts recommend shampooing only twice a week (with a shampoo that doesn’t contain SLS). Look for shampoos that contain natural oils and other ingredients that hydrate your scalp and hair.While you may want to cut back on shampooing, you should moisturize your hair daily. Why? Because your hair tends to dry out during the day, whether it’s from indoor heating in the winter or from wearing hats in the spring and summer.Whatever moisturizing product you choose, be sure to massage it evenly throughout the scalp and hair to get the best results.A low-maintenance hairstyle often works best for a lot of reasons, including that it will save you time while still looking good. But, you never know when you might find a look that you really like.Avoid products that contain alcohol, mineral oil, or petrolatum – which work to hold your style in place but may dry out your hair. Look for products with natural ingredients.Always have the right tools on hand when taking care of your hand, not the least of which is using the right comb. So, invest in a good afro comb because it has specially designed teeth that can detangle clumps of curly hair much better than other combs or brushes.It’s a natural reaction to want to scrub your greasy hair with the force of an MMA fighter to get all the oil it. Don’t do it. Over-scrubbing tends to stimulate the oil-producing sebaceous glands that are already active enough. Another tip for taking care of greasy hair – or for all types of hair, for that matter – is to avoid washing it with overly hot water.Unless your goal is to grow longer hair, it’s wise to keep your hair trimmed because it’s the best way to get rid of damaged hair such as split ends. You should trim your hair every six to eight weeks, even if it’s just a light trim. You’ll be amazed how healthy your hair looks after a modest cut. Whatever you do, however, don’t believe the old adage that your hair will come in stronger and fuller if you cut it. That’s an old wives’ tale that’s actually b.s., so don’t get a haircut because you think you’ll be able to grow thicker hair because of it.Whether it’s coloring your hair or getting a perm, chemical treatments can leave your hair dry, damaged, and dull. So, first, don’t overdo it with those treatments, but also avoid home treatments and seek the services of a good stylist instead. A knowledgeable barber or stylist will know how to prepare your hair and what products are best for your hair type. Plus, the results you’ll get from a professional will almost always look better than the results you’ll get doing it yourself.By the “right time” we don’t mean a mythical exact day when you should get your hair trimmed, but rather what time of the day you schedule the appointment with your barber or stylist. Most salons and shops are quieter at the beginning and end of each day, which increases your chances of having the full attention of your barber.Professional barbers and stylists abound, but when you find one you like, make him or her a valuable resource for everything hair. One way you know that you have a good barber is that they’ll take the time to talk about what you want while offering suggestions based on your goals and hair type. You want your barber to recommend products and styling tips that help you achieve the look you get from their craft. But you also want to come armed with information, whether it’s pictures from your phone or from magazines of what styles you like, etc.It wasn’t that long ago that hairspray was considered something that only women used, at least regularly. But hairspray is a vastly underrated and effective grooming tool for men, too, and it’s something you should consider using in much the same way as waxes, pomades, gels, clays, etc.The good news is that many of today’s hairsprays include ingredients that are good for your hair, unlike the chemical-laden sprays of the past. Additionally, sprays aren’t as heavy as waxes and gels and many men prefer their lightweight feel. If you’re a man with thin hair, using hairspray is an excellent way to add volume, while men with thick hair who may face styling challenges appreciate the hold that hairspray provides.The products that you apply to your hair over time may build up and cause your hair to look dull and lifeless. But a good clarifying shampoo will get rid of the build-up and make your hair look shinier. You can even use white vinegar as a hair rinse because it helps in balancing the pH level.Say what? Yes, an egg conditioner. Why? Because eggs are loaded with protein and essential minerals that your hair absolutely needs. So, give your hair an egg wash/conditioning treatment once a month. Let the egg wash penetrate deeply into your scalp because it will strengthen hair follicles from the inside out.If you’re someone who regularly uses hair wax, chances are that you like the way it makes your hair look, but it can be a pain in the ass to wash out of your hair. That said, apply shampoo to dry hair and then rinse it off; doing so will break down the wax and make it easier to get out. Repeat the process if necessary.Even if you’re using products with the strongest hold known to mankind, it’s hard to keep your hair looking exactly the way you want out throughout the day. While it’s hard to always have your favorite hair products with you at all time, a comb is your next best friend. Wetting a comb and touching up your hairstyle not only keeps your hair looking neat, but also reactivates most styling products.As mentioned, there’s plenty of debate about whether guys should shampoo every day. From reading the views of many experts, you get the feeling that less is more because excess shampooing may cause your hair to become dry and brittle. That’s especially true of shampoos that contain high levels of detergents and sulfates that strip your scalp and hair of natural oils.If you have hair that’s naturally oily and may look greasy, you may be resistant to only occasional shampooing. In many cases, however, it’s not that big of a deal and the natural oil is good for your hair. But it’s up to each person to decide how often they need to shampoo. As a general rule, however, try not to shampoo your hair every day.On the flip side, it’s OK to use a good conditioner every day (known as co-washing) because it minimizes split ends, tangles, breakage, and it doesn’t strip your hair of all of its natural oils; in fact, it replaces the oils that are washed away and keeps your hair moist. When you buy a conditioner, look for those that don’t contain waxes because they can make your hair look thin.Your hair is no different from your beard in that maintaining a healthy lifestyle will help it to reach its full potential. Taking care of yourself is obviously great for your health for a lot of reasons – including that you’ll lessen your risk of suffering from serious issues such as heart disease and obesity – and your hair will also appreciate your positive habits.For example, there’s a strong correlation between excess stress and premature graying, although that’s not true in every case. Meanwhile, you’ve certainly heard the expression that “this job (or child or significant other) is causing my hair to fall out!” There’s some truth to that, too, because stress restricts proper circulation to your scalp’s blood cells.A lack of protein has a definite impact on hair growth. After all, hair is made of protein and protein creates the building blocks for repairing and replacing bones, skin, muscles – and hair. People who don’t get enough protein in their diet will have slower new hair growth.What you eat also affects the overall health of your beard. It’s always important to maintain a healthy diet, of course, but a diet that’s particularly good for your hair should include the following:Your scalp can become dry – just like your skin – so it’s important to drink plenty of water daily. Make sure you’re staying hydrated if you exercise frequently or live in a warmer climate.Biotin is essential for keeping the fatty membranes of your hair cells healthy which, in turn, grow and multiply. Biotin represents the “right kind” of fat in your diet and you’ll find it in foods such as salmon, avocados, and nuts.Vitamins E and C also aid hair growth. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that improves blood flow, which promotes a healthier scalp, while vitamin C promotes the production of collagen, a key building block for healthy hair, skin, and nails.Many medications and supplements may lead to hair loss, as well. The list of medications includes antidepressants, blood pressure meds, excessive doses of vitamin A, and anticoagulants.Patience is a virtue but sometimes you just want to, well, speed things up; including when it comes to growing your hair. While your DNA is the most important factor in how fast your hair grows, you can help your hair grow faster. Here are some tips:It only makes sense that a healthy scalp ensures healthy-looking hair because your hair is an extension of your scalp. Also, your scalp has reparative properties that your hair doesn’t. Keep in mind the following tips when taking care of your scalp:Your sleeping habits have an impact on your overall hair health and growth because your body is in repair mode when you’re asleep. Growth hormones kick into gear when you’re snoozing and speed up cell reproduction, including scalp cells. Sleeping also increases blood circulation around the hair follicles. It’s recommended that you get seven to eight hours of sleep a night to reap the benefits of repair and reproduction.Maintaining your preferred hairstyle is much easier if you don’t try to force it. In other words, if you wear a side part, do it on the side of your head where your crown lies because that’s where you’ll find your natural part.The Guide to Manscaping: 10 Must-Know Body Grooming Rules & TipsSure, you're taking care of your head hair, but what about your parts down below?

                  Do you struggle to maintain your child's hair? Is your child's weak hair giving your sleepless nights? Healthy hair depends on a lot of factors and needs a lot of care. We give you some practical tips on child hair care to maintain your child's mane.There are a few basics to be followed when washing a child's hair. A child's hair growth depends on many factors and washing is one important one. Try to stick to natural shampoos, which are infused with vitamins and antioxidants, which will moisturise your child’s hair. You can also make your own shampoo for your child. Mix one-fourth cup of distilled water with an equivalent amount of herbal green tea. Add to this some lemon juice and honey. Your home-made shampoo is ready to use.Do the following after a shower:Oil is a good lubricant. She recommends olive or coconut oil, which doubles up as a natural sunscreen, and keeps the hair moist. Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause dryness.Brushing helps blood circulation in the scalp. The hair should be brushed from the bottom and worked till the top, removing the knots along the way. Trimming will reduce split ends and keep the hair healthy. “Trim once in two months for girls, and once a month for boys,” adds Edna.Regular exercise stimulates blood circulation and hair growth. Try to ensure your child indulges in physical activity or games twice to thrice a week.Wearing tight rubber bands can cause balding later. Avoid heavy metal clips as they damage the roots. Children should use plastic or light metal clips as accessories.Lice can be treated with a good anti-lice lotion. During puberty, many children get dandruff. You can treat this troublesome problem by alternately washing the hair with a medicated shampoo and a mild shampoo. Home remedies often work well on children. Apply warm coconut/olive oil, massage the scalp and leave it overnight, before washing with a gentle shampoo the next morning. Massaging the hair with a mixture of vinegar and warm water also helps. Note that if any shampoo is not completely washed off, or if conditioners or other styling products are used when there is dandruff, it could worsen the condition.Healthy hair demands regular oiling, shampooing and brushing. With a little bit of care and guidance from your side, your child can have a healthy mop of hair. (With inputs from Vasundhra Vasu and Edna Mahajan, hair experts from Chennai) Looking for expert tips and interesting articles on parenting?

You've made it through the fun part of your engagement (admit it: You loved snapping all those ring selfies), and now it's time to get into the nitty-gritty of looking fantastic on your big day. We're talking about your wedding beauty regimen because right now is the perfect excuse to give it a makeover so that you can have the best hair, skin, and nails of your life as you make your way down the aisle.

In addition to your wedding checklist, you have another set of to-dos to conquer before you say ""I do,"" but luckily this checklist is tons more fun than deciding where your feuding cousins should sit. Starting (or revamping) a wedding beauty regimen is a great way to practice some self-care, giving you the opportunity to de-stress ahead of your nuptials. And of course, each step will aid you in perfecting your wedding-day look, from smoothing your skin to strengthening your hair.

""To a certain extent, everyone wants to look like a supermodel on a daily basis, but we may not have the drive to act on it,"" says New York-based dermatologist Dendy Engelman, who helped Sofia Vergara prep for her wedding day. ""A wedding date gives you a deadline, and forces you to start making a move."" The clock is ticking and it's time to start checking things off your wedding beauty plan leading up to the big day.

Below, 40 things to consider when getting your bridal beauty routine in order.

From the top of your head to the tips of your toes, there's no end to the beauty bummers headed your way if you don't get your wedding-planning stress under control. On the complexion front, says NYC dermatologist Dendy Engelman, ""Many inflammatory conditions, including eczema, psoriasis, and keratosis pilaris, may be at least partially caused by stress. As stress weakens the immune system, chronic inflammation worsens.""
Excess anxiety can also disrupt your sleep, which in turn can lead to a gray, decidedly un-bridal complexion. The fix? Do what you can to chill out, whether that means hitting a yoga class after work or guided meditation apps such as Headspace and Omvana.

There are two key reasons to get a derm in your corner early on: One, they can assess your complexion's current state way better than you and your trusty magnifying mirror. And two, they can help you devise a strategy for achieving your dream-skin goals, be it softening pesky forehead wrinkles or zapping acne. ""Some treatments take time—up to several months—and you certainly want a game plan,"" says Engelman.

There's no better excuse than your wedding (and honeymoon) to treat yourself to laser hair removal. Is it a splurge? Yes, but it will be so worth it when shaving your armpits and legs is the last thing on your mind. Depending on where you go, sessions can range from $200 to $350, and ""planning should be done 9 to 12 months before the wedding, as it typically takes six sessions spaced six weeks apart to see permanent results,"" says Christian Karavalos, owner of Romeo & Juliette Laser Hair Removal Spa in NYC.

Derived from vitamin A, retinol increases cell turnover, unclogs pores, boosts collagen, and helps diminish hyperpigmentation. The prescription version, aka retinoid, is even more powerful. Still, as great as they are, both retinol and prescription-strength retinoids can cause redness and peeling at the outset, and even a possible uptick in acne before all those benefits kick in. ""I recommend patients start with a nonprescription retinol for at least four to eight weeks before progressing to a prescription retinoid,"" says Engelman. ""Their skin will tolerate it better.""

Find a reputable aesthetician in your area to help keep skin in tip-top shape. In your initial chat with a prospective aesthetician, make sure you address your goals and needs—don't be afraid to speak up. ""Look for someone who's a good listener,"" says NYC facialist Joanna Vargas. ""Old-school facialists would dictate your care. These days the best ones work with your budget, your goals, and your skin."" Don't go overboard with the treatments either, because flare-ups post-facials are likely. ""I would never want a bride to get a treatment with a new facialist close to her wedding date,"" she says.

As dead cells accumulate on the skin, they interfere with light reflection giving it a dull appearance, explains NYC-based dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner. The solution: Regular exfoliation paired with a brightening serum to give you the best lit-from-within glow on your wedding day. ""Regular exfoliation removes dead cells to improve radiance and can enhance the absorption of skin brightening products through the skin,"" he explains. ""I recommend exfoliating once per week initially, and advancing to twice per week after a month or so if you can tolerate it.""

Because vino is such a world-class dehydrator, capillary breaker, and radiance robber, downing endless glasses is one of the biggest crimes against complexion brides-to-be commit, says Vargas. If it's too hard to part ways with your wine, at least cutback and substitute that Bordeaux with liquefied leafy greens—especially during the few months leading up to your wedding. ""Green juice is great for skin because it's oxygenating and contains vital minerals to help stimulate the lymphatic system and drain out puffiness,"" says Vargas. ""One a day is great.""

""Most women don’t realize that your skincare routine truly starts in the shower and that using a gentle cleanser is key,"" explains dermatologist Dr. Mona Gohara. ""I recommend Dove Body Wash, which is sulfate-free, made with 100 percent gentle cleansers and provides softer, smoother skin after just one shower."" She recommends gently patting skin dry instead of rubbing and applying lotion within minutes of getting out of the shower to lock in moisture before it evaporates. Get in the habit of doing this for beautiful skin from head to toe come your wedding day.

Not only is it a notorious sun-magnet, but the décolletage is also prone to wrinkling for another reason, says Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Harold Lancer: tissue-thin skin. ""The skin of the neck and chest has a very different structure than that of the face and body,"" he says. ""The décolletage is an area with significantly less 'fat padding' and is generally more delicate than facial skin."" Translation: You might need to put some extra effort in there. Start with an OTC retinol product, and move on to prescription if your derm deems it necessary.

Keratosis pilaris (KP for short) is caused by excess keratin, which forms a plug at the site of a hair follicle. ""Unfortunately we don't know what triggers the buildup of keratin,"" says Engelman, who notes that KP often affects people with other skin conditions, like eczema. Triggers can include cold temperatures (resulting in a lack of moisture in the air), hormonal changes, food allergies, and a bride's arch-nemesis—stress. While there's no cure for KP, Engelman says you can treat the symptoms by exfoliating with a product like DermaDoctor KP Duty Scrub, ($46), to unplug the trapped keratin and dead skin cells that cause the bumps. ""Introducing moisture to the air via a humidifier can also help.""

Clocking in at under $20, a body brush might be one of the best engagement beauty investments you make. According to Engelman, dry-brushing yields major skin benefits, including exfoliation and increased blood circulation (i.e. a healthy glow). From an overall wellness standpoint, it also revs up the flow of lymph, the all-important fluid that whisks toxins out of our systems. ""Lymph relies on muscle movement to pass through the body, so if you're not an active person, dry-brushing is a wonderful tool to rid the body of waste,"" Engelman notes. ""There's real science behind it, and it really works when you commit to it."" Start with three dry-brushing sessions per week, building up to daily, and make sure to slather on some type of moisturizer afterward. ""I love to do it before the shower,"" says Engelman, ""and then hydrate with body oils before toweling off.""

Expert Sophie Evans recommends getting a trial spray tan before your dress fitting to figure out if you want to go darker or lighter before the big day. ""A week before the big day, start exfoliating your skin in preparation for your spray tan."" Pricing can range anywhere from $50 in a salon to $250 for house calls.

There's just no getting around the fact that chemical straightening exacts a hefty health toll on your strands. Making matters worse? A dizzying array of options, from Brazilian Blowout Original Solution to Japanese straightening. ""There are so many different keratin treatments and relaxers today,"" says colorist and salon owner Sharon Dorram. ""I suggest trying out the process months in advance to be sure it works for you.""

The general rule of thumb for big-day color shifts—whether you're going lighter or darker—is to stay within two shades of your natural hue. But no matter what color you want, planning is imperative. ""You should start planning your hair color as soon as you know how your hair will be styled for the wedding,"" says Stephanie Brown, colorist at IGK Salon in NYC. Bring inspiration photos to your colorist of choice and be clear about your hair goals. You should also plan to get your hair touched up 7 to 10 days before the wedding to ensure it looks its best. ""You want to have enough time to know you like the final color in case you need to change anything,"" she notes.

As great as H20 is for you internally (it hydrates and debloats, so drink up), when it comes to hair, water won't do those pricey highlights or rich faux brunette any favors. ""Over-shampooing lifts, dulls, and fades hair color,"" says Dorram. ""I always suggest shampooing no more than three to four times a week. The best is to rinse hair and use a mild detangler in between shampoos.""

Color or no color, this is the time to lavish extra TLC on your locks. You can head to the salon for a deep conditioning treatment or you can DIY it, by slathering wet hair with your mega-hydrator of choice. For home use, Dorram suggests a few drops of vitamin E oil mixed into your conditioner or hair mask of choice. ""We generally make a conditioning plan built around the wedding date,"" Dorram says. ""If the hair is in bad shape, we suggest weekly or biweekly treatments.""

Celebrity hairstylist George Kyriakos, who has 25-plus years of experience says, ""You want a timeless look—an elevated version of yourself. If you never wear your hair up because you hate your ears, don't let anyone talk you into that."" Translation: Steer clear of those over-the-top Instagram updos and oversized hair accessories and go with a hairstyle that feels natural to you when you do your hair trials.

If your natural hair is lacking in the volume department or your hairstyle of choice requires some extra length, look into trying hair extensions. ""Extensions help create a variety of styles, stay put all day long through photos and dancing, and make hair look like the best version of your normal style,"" says Edward Tricomi, co-founder and stylist at Warren-Tricomi Salons. It takes about a month to order the hair so he recommends going in for a consultation at least two months ahead of the wedding date. ""If you are doing permanent extensions, I would have them put in a week or two ahead of the wedding and for clip-ins, a week before is fine.""

Give a big round of applause to satin-finish foundation, a universally flattering formula. ""Satin has a luminosity, and makes the skin look pretty,"" says mega makeup mogul Sonia Kashuk. ""You want that little bit of glow and dewiness that you don't get with a matte formula. But at the same time, you don't want too much shimmer. Satin gives the kind of balance that's most reminiscent of natural skin.""

""Those pictures need to transcend time,"" she notes. ""If you're not a big makeup-wearer, don't just do it for your wedding day. Wear what you normally wear, but refine it,"" she says. ""You can even just add a lash to do something special. No one will ever realize you're in false lashes. The point is to stay away from anything too extreme, or obvious.""

Afraid the waterproof mascara just won't cut it on the big day? Consider lash extensions. Clementina Richardson, founder of Envious Lashes in NYC, says ""Lash extensions are great for brides who don't want to worry about having beautiful lashes from the rehearsal dinner through the honeymoon."" She also adds that they look great in photographs. ""Since eyelash extensions are placed individually on existing lashes, no matter how close up the camera is, they will appear natural."" Richardson recommends getting your first full set a few weeks out to test drive them and to return three to four days before the wedding for a fill-in. ""When you go back, you can make changes to your previous look,"" she says.

When: 3 weeks out, and 3 days out for a touch-up

Although contouring can be flattering when done right, Kashuk recommends proceeding with caution for your big day. ""When you have severe contrast, the face doesn't match up to the rest of the body."" To optimize the technique, opt for a sheer, blendable cream formula. ""There's a way to contour in a more natural way, using see-through, transparent textures,"" she explains. ""Add just a hint of depth under the cheekbones. Very subtle, very sheer.""

When: Day-of
Alyssa Greenberg
""My biggest piece of advice for brides is to stay away from extremes of any kind,"" Kashuk notes. ""Nothing should jump, so that means no overly strong anything. It's about balance and softness. Want to rock a red lip for your wedding? Okay. But keep the lip line soft and undefined.""

We've all been guilty of over-plucking, but now is the time to seriously put the tweezers down and give up the threading and waxing. Why? When you over-pluck, you lose all of your natural arch shape, which can change your facial expression altogether. ""Every bride needs a good aesthetician to whip those brows into shape before the big day,"" says Jared Bailey, Benefit Cosmetics global brow expert. ""For a classic approach to brow-shaping, you want to find brows that fit your face—brows should be a mirror of your facial features. That’s how they start to bring balance to the entire face and eyes.""

""The only thing that comes second to finding the perfect dress for the big day is finding the perfect brow wardrobe,"" says Bailey. ""You need to look for quality products to prevent things like a makeup meltdown or flaky gels."" He says now is the time to invest in highly pigmented, long-wear brow products that don’t flake or budge. After all, you'll be taking pictures nonstop this year. Bailey's tip when color-matching your brow arsenal: ""Be sure to choose a shade that mimics the same color as your brow hair—that’s key to making the product blend in effortlessly.""

If your brows are so sparse that they need serious help or you've been dying to try microblading, consider doing it two months out. With microblading, you can achieve your dream natural brows without worrying about sweat or water getting in the way of beautiful brows. ""They will need a week to heal initially and then you have to go in for a touch-up four to six weeks after,"" says Eyebrow Doctor founder Piret Aava. So the whole process calls for (you guessed it) planning ahead. ""Do your research before you get microblading,"" advises Aava. ""You want to make sure you go to someone who has a good reputation and does work that looks natural.""

A gorgeous smile starts with healthy gums and teeth. You can also use this time to talk to your dentist about teeth whitening or investing in braces or clear aligners. If a crooked smile has you down, the wedding might be a good excuse to pony up for Invisalign and finally achieve a perfectly straight smile. Invisalign Express gets you the perfect smile in six months and will run you up to $4,000.

You might love Merlot, but Merlot doesn't love your pearly whites. ""If you want white teeth for your wedding, you have to give up red wine,"" says Dr. Marc Lowenberg of LLK Dentistry in NYC. ""Because it's a liquid, it seeps into your enamel and darkens your teeth in a way that, even if you get them cleaned, they're not going to get lighter. You'll have to get them bleached. And if you're a wine addict, you need to drink it through a straw, as ridiculous as that sounds."" If you get them whitened, then use a straw when drinking coffee, too.

When: 6 months out, or after your first in-office bleaching

If you want to amp up your smile, consider splurging on professional-grade tooth whitening. These days a whitening treatment can be done in-office in under 1 hour and comes with convenient take-home whitening trays, depending on the level of stains. You can easily whiten your teeth four to six shades and results last for up to a year.

Unlike red wine, which gives your teeth a nice little bath of hard-to-dislodge color, most food and drink stains fall into the surface category and are easily scrubbed-off in an appointment with your hygienist. Be it berries, coffee, or marinara sauce, says Lowenberg, ""anything that will stain a white blouse will stain your teeth."" It's wise to follow up that first dentist appointment with another follow-up cleaning a few weeks out for a truly flawless smile.

Nail artist Tom Bachik says the best thing you can do for your nails is to keep them hydrated. ""When they dry out they become brittle, leading to chips and cracks,"" he says. ""Keep nails flexible and strong by using an oil on your cuticles nightly before bed."" Get into the habit of applying oil on each nail before bed every night to ensure beautiful ring-selfie hands year-round.

Nails are important, but so are your hands. Amy Ling, founder of Sundays Nail Studio in NYC recommends using a gentle scrub weekly and following it up with a generous amount of lotion and cuticle oil. ""Apply sunscreen to the back of each hand to protect [the] skin,"" she adds.

As much as we love nail art, save it for the bachelorette party and the honeymoon. You don't want anything taking away from your natural beauty on your wedding day. You can still have fun, but keep it neutral for the best look. ""Like the red carpet, I believe wedding nails should be timeless, classic, and elegant,"" says Bachik. ""That doesn't mean brides can't have a little personal style. But keep the art simple and the colors tonal. Nails should be the perfect accessories to complete your look, not compete with it.""

As an Equinox Fitness Global Personal Trainer of the Year and founder of Team Awesome LLC, Ed Gemdjian is immersed in all the latest fitness findings. So when he says sleep is now considered the third pillar of health—along with a sound diet and lots of exercise—it's time to hit the sack. ""Sleep is important for so many reasons,"" he says. ""We produce the highest amounts of natural HGH (human growth hormone) while we sleep, which is responsible for regenerating and creating new cells of all our body tissues—skin, muscle, hair. When we sleep, it's the only time our brain can repair and reorganize. And the relaxed breathing state during sleep reduces stress by calming our central nervous system.""

""I've seen deprivation crash diets backfire time and time again,"" says registered dietician Brooke Alpert. ""Because you're basically starving yourself, you're going to break down and binge, regaining the weight you lost and feeling bad about yourself."" Not to mention how cranky and miserable you'll be in this highly social period of your life. Alpert recommends you aim to have a healthy (sugar-free) meal or snack every three to four hours.

If you're lucky enough to have a trainer on the wedding payroll alongside the planner, caterer, and florist, it can be easy to slack off between appointments on the days you're not training together. ""At Equinox, we provide our clients with specific strategies to follow on their own, just as much as when they're training with us,"" says Gemdjian. ""Taking ownership can be very empowering, and improved self-esteem can go a long way when planning a wedding."" Another reason to flex your self-discipline muscles? You'll build habits that last through your honeymoon and beyond.

Upper-body strength training should be incorporated into your workouts leading up to your wedding. ""Working out your upper back and chest is not just muscle-defining, but it will help your posture,"" says certified trainer Holly Roser. ""We look down at our phones all day and hunch over our laptops, which tightens up our chest muscles."" Roser guides her bridal clients through an upper body-chiseling program that includes rows, deltoid flys, and low-seated rows. She also lasers in on the triceps muscles with dips, cable pull-downs, and push-ups.

Is it easy? No, especially if you've got a major sweet tooth. But the list of beauty goodies—not to mention the positive mental state—from kicking it to the curb is virtually endless, says Alpert. ""For brides-to-be, removing sugar will help keep skin clear, plump, and fresh-looking,"" she adds. ""And even more important, for anyone coping with guest lists, seating charts, and in-laws, limiting sugar intake can help control stress levels and keep you more even-keeled and clear-minded.""

Hopefully, you're already slashing your sugar intake. Now it's time to boot liquor, too.

Every student is on the look out for top study tips which can help him/her score more while putting in less effort. Most people believe that studying for longer hours is the only way to improve grades and performance. However, the trick lies not in studying more, rather, studying efficiently that reaps maximum results. Ask yourself, ‘If you are able to achieve the same results in 2 hours of study, why would you spend 4 hours on the same”? The idea here is that students must strive to follow study tips that augment their efficiency and not force them to elongate their study time.Table of ContentsA lot of students believe that study tips are over rated and do not have any real world impact on academic performance. This perception is both a myth and a reality. If you search the internet, you will come across many tips and tricks which have no basis and, thus, are unlikely to help improve your grades. However, if you truly make an effort to identify the right tips, you are setting yourself up for success.Why you need study tips for students is easy. These and tried and tested practices which are served to you on a silver platter. However, simply knowing a tip doesn’t guarantee good grades. It completely depends on how well you are able to implement the same as a part of your daily schedule that makes the difference.Now that we understand what study tips are and the importance they carry, it is crucial to learn about the tips that actually work. When you ask around there will be numerous tips that you come across. However, blindly following all will only overwhelm you without creating any real impact. Following are top 7 study tips for students which are highly effective and have been tried and tested by learners across.One of the first study tips for students is to ensure that they do not overburden themselves. Going overboard might get overwhelming, leading to decreased learning. Therefore, it is best to space out your learning. If you try to do all topics at once, you will only end up getting confused, without retaining any knowledge from any topic. It is ideal to take one topic at the time, study it well and then go on to the next one. This is especially true if your topics have any kind of overlap.It is best to have some kind of change between two topics that overlap. Spacing out this way will help you absorb the learning of the first and prepare your mind for what is to come. If you burden yourself with everything at once, you will quickly reach your saturation point and end up worsening your grades.When it comes to study tips for students, this one is very important. While there are certain topics you can just read and excel at, there are others which require more effort. This is especially true to the analytical and objective subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Thus, an ideal approach would be to start your learning by writing. You cannot understand an engineering question by reading it verbally. Once you have conceptual clarity attained through writing, start practicing.Practicing is about solving similar questions to ensure that your concepts are strong and well revised and you do not need to go back to the books time and again. Practicing enough prepares you for the testing stage. Improving grades is not about how well you know the concept, rather how well you are able to reproduce the same in an examination. Testing comes in handy here. Taking tests in a time bound manner will help you manage your time and efforts in a way that plays on your strengths. Thus, you will find yourself with all the necessary resources to improve your grades.Studying in silos can be effective, but at times, there is a need to study with others. This is very true when there are certain concepts that you have grasp over and others which your peers understand well. Therefore, forming study groups is another one of the study tips for students. It works in a simple quid pro quo fashion where you help your friends with some parts of the coursework and they cover the other parts.It might also be a good idea to get support from your family members. If you are learning a particular answer, you can definitely request someone from your family to quiz you once on the same and help you in areas wherever you are going wrong. At the same time, you can seek support for online learning platforms like TutorBin which bring together expert tutors from all across the globe and can assist in your learning. The bottom line here is that support while learning is desirable and should be sought and given.It often happens that when you in mission mode to score well, you lose track of everything else and your health takes a back seat. If you look closely, when you are too involved in studying, you tend to forget eating, drinking or even sleeping on time. While you might think that all the time you save from there, you might put to studying, however, in the longer run, you’re making an unhealthy choice.Thus, one of the top study tips focuses on ensuring a healthy lifestyle while you study. This refers to consuming a balanced diet and keeping yourself hydrated. Without proper nutrition, your brain will not work at its best, causing a slip up while you study. In addition to physical health, you should give importance to your mental health as well. Don’t stress yourself too much and practice meditation to keep all the anxiety at bay.Taking short breaks are important for effective learning. If you study for 8-10 hours straight, what you retain at the end will be quite less of what you actually consumed. Thus, as another important study tip to improve grades, you must take adequate breaks. In fact, you can make breaks as a reward for some learning well done and see it as positive reinforcement. This is not to say that you take a break after every page you cover.What this highlights is the need to give yourself enough time to replenish after an intensive study session to ensure that your learning bears some fruit. If you keep going without taking a break every once in a while, you will hit your saturation point very early on in your study schedule, defeating the whole purpose of following study tips.Being process driven is very important if you wish to improve your grades. It is vital that you have a well thought routine which you follow properly. There is no set routine or process that works for everyone as everyone differs in their learning habits and behavior. What is important is to ensure that you are able to craft a routine and process that works best for you.At the same time, you can explore creating small tricks to help you retain the knowledge you gauge. Acronyms, relationships, mnemonic devices etc. are simple tricks that most learners use and find very effective. Pick up or create tricks that catch your attention and you feel are worth experimenting with.Sitting in the same place, all the time, especially in the wake of the pandemic can be very monotonous and detrimental to learning. Thus, it is a good idea to experiment with changing your learning settings every now and then. You might want to learn one topic in one corner of the room and another at some other place. Even the way you learn can be refreshed. One of the top study tips is to be energized and active which new surroundings can bring to you.Another benefit will be that when you move from one surrounding to another, you will also get physically active which will lead to better health outcomes as well.The above mentioned study tips are all quite effective and drive great results. However, implementing all of them together might be too much of an overkill. Thus, it is best that you start with one or two tips at a time, seamlessly integrate them in your schedule and move onto the next one. The bottom line is don’t blindly follow these tips because they are best practices. Rather, see what works for you personally and can help improve your grades.Your email address will not be published.

109,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g36278510/thin-curly-hair-care-tips-products/,"It's truly a labor of love over here.Lil anecdote about yours truly: The first time I ever deep-dove into the magical world of ~the internet~ was in middle school, when I spent a full weekend attempting to figure out how to style my fine, flat, thin, curly hair. I’m talkin’ sketchy curl forums, typo-riddled blogs, and the occasional ill-advised DM with strangers about my curl type. Cut to me, a decade (plus) later, and I can confidently say that after literally all of the trial and error, I’m now a true expert on the best products and tricks for thin, curly hair.I’ll preface this with the not-so-fun news, though: There’s no single curl product that will magically make your curls look 10x thicker (trust, I’ve tried them all). Instead, if you really wanna amp up your curl pattern and get major volume, you need to take a multi-step approach that starts with how you style your hair (the most important part, IMO), and ends with what products you actually use to keep ‘em voluminous. Yup, that sounds overwhelming, but I promise you it's not. Just follow my lead, starting with...Despite what you’ve probs heard, shampoos are not the devil for curly hair—at least, not for thin, curly hair that gets greasy by the end of the day (hi, me). Fine curls can’t handle the butters and oils in cleansing conditioners and co-washes; we need a little cleansing action to keep our curls light and defined. The key here is to use a sulfate-free shampoo (this one from Maui Moisture is my fav), which still breaks down scalp oils and buildup, but won’t strip curls.Certain ingredients (see: silicones, waxes, mineral oils) will quickly build up on the surface of your curls, weighing them down and making them look frizzy, flat, and greasy. I saw a major change in my hair once I started using a clarifying shampoo—yup, one filled with harsher sulfates—every 2 to 3 weeks to break down buildup and “reset” my curls. Pro tip: Cover your ends in conditioner both before and after clarifying to help keep it from drying out.Up until last year (!!) I spent my entire life ignoring the whole upside-down styling advice I saw on every tutorial and curl blog, because I genuinely thought it wouldn’t make a difference. Hey, I tilt my head side to side when applying curl products; isn’t that good enough? No. Omg, NO. I was so freakin’ wrong. This styling tip has been the biggest game-changer of my life’s curl journey—more than any product or haircut—and I legit urge you to try it.The gist is simple: Just flip your sopping-wet hair over in the shower, comb through it, then cup and squish a palmful of product (conditioner, leave-in, hair gel, cream, whatever) into your hair with your hands. That’s it. Need to layer on another product? Cup and squish it in. Feel like you used too much product? Cup and squish a palmful of water in to dilute it. The reason the upside-down-squishing technique (often called squish to condish, or S2C) is so beloved is because it encourages definition and volume at every step, all without the frizz.Above is my favorite tutorial showing the squishing mechanism in action on fine hair. FWIW, I don’t squish in my conditioner (my roots get too greasy), but I do squish in my curl cream and mousse.After trying virtually every product combo, I’ve found my fine curls do best with a lightweight curl cream (I swear by Ouai’s Fragrance-Free Curl Cream) for definition, and a lightweight, volumizing curl mousse layered on top for hold. I’ll first squish the curl cream through my sopping-wet hair in the shower (upside down, natch), and then squish in a few golf ball-size puffs of mousse.The second biggest game-changer for getting volume on fine, thin, curly hair? Plopping. Plopping is technique that uses a T-shirt to dry your curls in a self-contained mound on top of your head, helping to increase definition and cut down on frizz. Unlike when you twist a towel around your head—which pulls out your curls—plopping keeps your wet curls compact and scrunched, accordion-style, so your roots stay volumized, your curls stay clumped, and your hair cuticle stays smooth (thanks to the soft cotton fabric).I usually let my curls air-dry, even if that means sleeping on damp hair (more on how I do that below), solely because I actually like my curls loose and messy, rather than perfectly spiraled. But on days when I want my curls to really spring up and get major volume and definition, I’ll diffuse right after plopping (here’s my favorite tutorial on how to diffuse curly hair, FYI). This universal diffuser attachment fits most blow-dryers (but measure first!) and has long prongs and a wide bowl to evenly cup your curls while you dry.Sleeping on my thin curls usually means waking up with flat, stretched-out waves and frizz, especially if I sleep with my hair in a ponytail, topknot, or bun. So to preserve my curly hair while I sleep—and keep the volume—I swear by Medusa clipping, which works especially well on short hair. It’s essentially just strategically clipping up sections of your hair with small clips (I use Goody’s Mini Hair Clips or Scunci’s Mini Jaw Clips) to keep curls intact overnight.Don’t worry—you can’t feel the clips when you sleep (they’re on top of your head, not smashed against your pillow), and even if you’re a chaotic sleeper like I am, the clips still manage to keep enough of my hair under control for it to look good once I take it down in the morning. Just be warned: Your hair will look a bit cray after you unclip it, but give it time to settle (think 10-15 minutes). I usually just clip the sides back and off my face while I get dressed and do my morning thang, then remove the clips and live my life.A post shared by Chloe Metzger (@chloe_metzger)Blah, blah, blah, I know this sounds obvious, but getting a layered haircut is truly key for giving volume to fine, thin, curly hair. I usually ask the stylist to give me “a ton of short layers, with the shortest layer still long enough to fit into a ponytail,” and describe my ideal hair shape as a circle, rather than a pyramid. (Also, FYI, this isn’t my natural curl pattern—the stylist touched up my hair with a curling iron, so I know I have more of a ~wavy~ texture here, but the layers still shine through.)Another pro tip: Because most curl types tend to shrink up a bit as they dry, some stylists get nervous about accidentally cutting off too much length, even if you ask them. But if your curls have minimal shrinkage (like mine!), let your stylist know ahead of time, so they don’t leave you with layers that are too long and heavy.Listen, no matter how well you follow these steps, your flat, fine, thin curls are probably still going to need some extra help in maintaining their volume all day. And usually, that help will come in the form of a texturizing spray, texturizing powder, and/or dry shampoo, like this hybrid from Briogeo. I usually sprinkle a bit along my roots in the morning, gently massage my scalp upside down, and I’m left with non-sticky volume and a bit of oil-absorbing powder that keeps the greasies away.",7.0075,9.69,6,9.04,3.3,1233

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.For most of us, greasy hair is inevitable at some point or another. But—as inconvenient as it can be, especially on days where you have no time to hit the shower—it’s a somewhat misunderstood issue. Having an oily scalp isn’t in itself bad—natural oils actually protect your scalp from environmental damage—but there can be too much of a good thing, especially if you have fine or straight hair. Excess oil can make your hair feel limp, lifeless, and a little grimy, even if you do have time to shampoo every day. Luckily there are a ton of easy fixes you can make that don’t involve tossing your hair into a ponytail (though that’s always a safe bet). We spoke to hairstylists about why you get oily hair in the first place, and the best tips to manage grease. Just as with the skin on your face, the sebaceous glands on your scalp produce oil as a protective barrier, and to keep the skin from drying out. And just as with your face, some people simply produce more oil. “Everyone’s scalp is different,” says Lauren Grummel, a New York City hairstylist. “The amount of oil your scalp produces is generally based off genetics.” If you’ve always had greasy hair, chances are it’s genetic. But if it’s a new change, it could be due to the products you’re using. Grummel says that overwashing your hair is also a common cause of a greasy scalp, as this can kick oil production into overdrive since your scalp is trying to make up for the lost oil. It could also be a seasonal thing. “Twice a year you may be more prone to things like thinning, hair loss, static, or greasiness,” says celebrity hairstylist Laura Polko. “Be aware of these and adjust your products accordingly. More importantly, ride it out. It will pass.”The obvious answer here is to wash your hair, but for those days when you can’t make it to the shower, Grummel says to reach for the dry shampoo. However, she says to use it only when you need to, as it can make oil worse in the long run.“Dry shampoo can clog the pores on your scalp,” she says. “Just as we wouldn’t wear the same makeup on our face without washing it for days, we shouldn’t leave on and add styling  products to our hair for days and days. But dry shampoo is great if you know you’ll be washing it out the next day.” You can also try washing your hair less. While this seems counterintuitive, it will actually slow oil production down in the long run. Start by washing every other day, slowly working your way to once or twice a week. While there may be an adjustment period, it will eventually level out.  If a greasy scalp is a new problem, Polko recommends looking for keywords like clarifying and detoxifying on your shampoos. She also says to try a scalp scrub to banish product buildup. “It’s important to start at the scalp—you need a fresh scalp to keep hair healthy,” she says. “Finding  the right shampoo and conditioner makes all the difference,” says Grummel. She suggests trying shampoos that are paraben- and sulfate-free, as they’re gentler on your hair (she loves  Act + Acre’s products for the scalp). She also recommends seeking out ingredients like tea tree oil, thyme extract, and rosemary extract, which balance oil production. “Witch Hazel is [another] known natural antiseptic that helps detoxify the hair and scalp. It also tightens the cuticle, adds radiance, and restores balance so that hair looks and feels soothed and softened.” To prevent a build-up of oil and product, Grummel recommends using a prewash like Kevin Murphy’s Maxi Wash once a week before your regular shampoo and conditioner for a deep cleaning. She also recommends applying your conditioner with your head tipped upside down, so you can really focus on the ends. “This will guarantee that conditioner won’t get on your roots, making your hair greasier.”She also says to make sure you’re thoroughly washing your hair. “Sometimes two or even three shampoos are necessary, especially if you haven’t washed in a few days and have product build-up.” Once your hair is dry, Grummel recommends brushing with a boar-bristle brush like a Mason Pearson to make sure the oils from your scalp are evenly distributed. Finally,  you can always just work with what have.  “Don’t fight your hair’s natural oil, and avoid overusing dry shampoo to prevent your hair from becoming dependent on it,” says Polko. “Greasy hair is the best for a slicked back look. Consider a tight pony or bun, or a half-up hairstyle.” She likes to use a hair mask like NatureLab. Tokyo Perfect Repair Treatment Masque to slick back second- or third-day hair for extra moisture, or suggests using clips or headbands to hide any grease. Bella Cacciatore is the beauty associate at Glamour.

Every student is on the look out for top study tips which can help him/her score more while putting in less effort. Most people believe that studying for longer hours is the only way to improve grades and performance. However, the trick lies not in studying more, rather, studying efficiently that reaps maximum results. Ask yourself, ‘If you are able to achieve the same results in 2 hours of study, why would you spend 4 hours on the same”? The idea here is that students must strive to follow study tips that augment their efficiency and not force them to elongate their study time.Table of ContentsA lot of students believe that study tips are over rated and do not have any real world impact on academic performance. This perception is both a myth and a reality. If you search the internet, you will come across many tips and tricks which have no basis and, thus, are unlikely to help improve your grades. However, if you truly make an effort to identify the right tips, you are setting yourself up for success.Why you need study tips for students is easy. These and tried and tested practices which are served to you on a silver platter. However, simply knowing a tip doesn’t guarantee good grades. It completely depends on how well you are able to implement the same as a part of your daily schedule that makes the difference.Now that we understand what study tips are and the importance they carry, it is crucial to learn about the tips that actually work. When you ask around there will be numerous tips that you come across. However, blindly following all will only overwhelm you without creating any real impact. Following are top 7 study tips for students which are highly effective and have been tried and tested by learners across.One of the first study tips for students is to ensure that they do not overburden themselves. Going overboard might get overwhelming, leading to decreased learning. Therefore, it is best to space out your learning. If you try to do all topics at once, you will only end up getting confused, without retaining any knowledge from any topic. It is ideal to take one topic at the time, study it well and then go on to the next one. This is especially true if your topics have any kind of overlap.It is best to have some kind of change between two topics that overlap. Spacing out this way will help you absorb the learning of the first and prepare your mind for what is to come. If you burden yourself with everything at once, you will quickly reach your saturation point and end up worsening your grades.When it comes to study tips for students, this one is very important. While there are certain topics you can just read and excel at, there are others which require more effort. This is especially true to the analytical and objective subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Thus, an ideal approach would be to start your learning by writing. You cannot understand an engineering question by reading it verbally. Once you have conceptual clarity attained through writing, start practicing.Practicing is about solving similar questions to ensure that your concepts are strong and well revised and you do not need to go back to the books time and again. Practicing enough prepares you for the testing stage. Improving grades is not about how well you know the concept, rather how well you are able to reproduce the same in an examination. Testing comes in handy here. Taking tests in a time bound manner will help you manage your time and efforts in a way that plays on your strengths. Thus, you will find yourself with all the necessary resources to improve your grades.Studying in silos can be effective, but at times, there is a need to study with others. This is very true when there are certain concepts that you have grasp over and others which your peers understand well. Therefore, forming study groups is another one of the study tips for students. It works in a simple quid pro quo fashion where you help your friends with some parts of the coursework and they cover the other parts.It might also be a good idea to get support from your family members. If you are learning a particular answer, you can definitely request someone from your family to quiz you once on the same and help you in areas wherever you are going wrong. At the same time, you can seek support for online learning platforms like TutorBin which bring together expert tutors from all across the globe and can assist in your learning. The bottom line here is that support while learning is desirable and should be sought and given.It often happens that when you in mission mode to score well, you lose track of everything else and your health takes a back seat. If you look closely, when you are too involved in studying, you tend to forget eating, drinking or even sleeping on time. While you might think that all the time you save from there, you might put to studying, however, in the longer run, you’re making an unhealthy choice.Thus, one of the top study tips focuses on ensuring a healthy lifestyle while you study. This refers to consuming a balanced diet and keeping yourself hydrated. Without proper nutrition, your brain will not work at its best, causing a slip up while you study. In addition to physical health, you should give importance to your mental health as well. Don’t stress yourself too much and practice meditation to keep all the anxiety at bay.Taking short breaks are important for effective learning. If you study for 8-10 hours straight, what you retain at the end will be quite less of what you actually consumed. Thus, as another important study tip to improve grades, you must take adequate breaks. In fact, you can make breaks as a reward for some learning well done and see it as positive reinforcement. This is not to say that you take a break after every page you cover.What this highlights is the need to give yourself enough time to replenish after an intensive study session to ensure that your learning bears some fruit. If you keep going without taking a break every once in a while, you will hit your saturation point very early on in your study schedule, defeating the whole purpose of following study tips.Being process driven is very important if you wish to improve your grades. It is vital that you have a well thought routine which you follow properly. There is no set routine or process that works for everyone as everyone differs in their learning habits and behavior. What is important is to ensure that you are able to craft a routine and process that works best for you.At the same time, you can explore creating small tricks to help you retain the knowledge you gauge. Acronyms, relationships, mnemonic devices etc. are simple tricks that most learners use and find very effective. Pick up or create tricks that catch your attention and you feel are worth experimenting with.Sitting in the same place, all the time, especially in the wake of the pandemic can be very monotonous and detrimental to learning. Thus, it is a good idea to experiment with changing your learning settings every now and then. You might want to learn one topic in one corner of the room and another at some other place. Even the way you learn can be refreshed. One of the top study tips is to be energized and active which new surroundings can bring to you.Another benefit will be that when you move from one surrounding to another, you will also get physically active which will lead to better health outcomes as well.The above mentioned study tips are all quite effective and drive great results. However, implementing all of them together might be too much of an overkill. Thus, it is best that you start with one or two tips at a time, seamlessly integrate them in your schedule and move onto the next one. The bottom line is don’t blindly follow these tips because they are best practices. Rather, see what works for you personally and can help improve your grades.Your email address will not be published.

115,https://tamil.boldsky.com/health/food/summer-foods-that-help-in-healthy-hair-growth-031188.html,"Improving ones grades and performance is an integral part of academic life. Every student is on the look out for top study tips which can help him/her score more while putting in less effort. Most people believe that studying for longer hours is the only way to improve grades and performance. However, the trick lies not in studying more, rather, studying efficiently that reaps maximum results. Ask yourself, ‘If you are able to achieve the same results in 2 hours of study, why would you spend 4 hours on the same”? The idea here is that students must strive to follow study tips that augment their efficiency and not force them to elongate their study time.Table of ContentsA lot of students believe that study tips are over rated and do not have any real world impact on academic performance. This perception is both a myth and a reality. If you search the internet, you will come across many tips and tricks which have no basis and, thus, are unlikely to help improve your grades. However, if you truly make an effort to identify the right tips, you are setting yourself up for success.Why you need study tips for students is easy. These and tried and tested practices which are served to you on a silver platter. However, simply knowing a tip doesn’t guarantee good grades. It completely depends on how well you are able to implement the same as a part of your daily schedule that makes the difference.Now that we understand what study tips are and the importance they carry, it is crucial to learn about the tips that actually work. When you ask around there will be numerous tips that you come across. However, blindly following all will only overwhelm you without creating any real impact. Following are top 7 study tips for students which are highly effective and have been tried and tested by learners across.One of the first study tips for students is to ensure that they do not overburden themselves. Going overboard might get overwhelming, leading to decreased learning. Therefore, it is best to space out your learning. If you try to do all topics at once, you will only end up getting confused, without retaining any knowledge from any topic. It is ideal to take one topic at the time, study it well and then go on to the next one. This is especially true if your topics have any kind of overlap.It is best to have some kind of change between two topics that overlap. Spacing out this way will help you absorb the learning of the first and prepare your mind for what is to come. If you burden yourself with everything at once, you will quickly reach your saturation point and end up worsening your grades.When it comes to study tips for students, this one is very important. While there are certain topics you can just read and excel at, there are others which require more effort. This is especially true to the analytical and objective subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Thus, an ideal approach would be to start your learning by writing. You cannot understand an engineering question by reading it verbally. Once you have conceptual clarity attained through writing, start practicing.Practicing is about solving similar questions to ensure that your concepts are strong and well revised and you do not need to go back to the books time and again. Practicing enough prepares you for the testing stage. Improving grades is not about how well you know the concept, rather how well you are able to reproduce the same in an examination. Testing comes in handy here. Taking tests in a time bound manner will help you manage your time and efforts in a way that plays on your strengths. Thus, you will find yourself with all the necessary resources to improve your grades.Studying in silos can be effective, but at times, there is a need to study with others. This is very true when there are certain concepts that you have grasp over and others which your peers understand well. Therefore, forming study groups is another one of the study tips for students. It works in a simple quid pro quo fashion where you help your friends with some parts of the coursework and they cover the other parts.It might also be a good idea to get support from your family members. If you are learning a particular answer, you can definitely request someone from your family to quiz you once on the same and help you in areas wherever you are going wrong. At the same time, you can seek support for online learning platforms like TutorBin which bring together expert tutors from all across the globe and can assist in your learning. The bottom line here is that support while learning is desirable and should be sought and given.It often happens that when you in mission mode to score well, you lose track of everything else and your health takes a back seat. If you look closely, when you are too involved in studying, you tend to forget eating, drinking or even sleeping on time. While you might think that all the time you save from there, you might put to studying, however, in the longer run, you’re making an unhealthy choice.Thus, one of the top study tips focuses on ensuring a healthy lifestyle while you study. This refers to consuming a balanced diet and keeping yourself hydrated. Without proper nutrition, your brain will not work at its best, causing a slip up while you study. In addition to physical health, you should give importance to your mental health as well. Don’t stress yourself too much and practice meditation to keep all the anxiety at bay.Taking short breaks are important for effective learning. If you study for 8-10 hours straight, what you retain at the end will be quite less of what you actually consumed. Thus, as another important study tip to improve grades, you must take adequate breaks. In fact, you can make breaks as a reward for some learning well done and see it as positive reinforcement. This is not to say that you take a break after every page you cover.What this highlights is the need to give yourself enough time to replenish after an intensive study session to ensure that your learning bears some fruit. If you keep going without taking a break every once in a while, you will hit your saturation point very early on in your study schedule, defeating the whole purpose of following study tips.Being process driven is very important if you wish to improve your grades. It is vital that you have a well thought routine which you follow properly. There is no set routine or process that works for everyone as everyone differs in their learning habits and behavior. What is important is to ensure that you are able to craft a routine and process that works best for you.At the same time, you can explore creating small tricks to help you retain the knowledge you gauge. Acronyms, relationships, mnemonic devices etc. are simple tricks that most learners use and find very effective. Pick up or create tricks that catch your attention and you feel are worth experimenting with.Sitting in the same place, all the time, especially in the wake of the pandemic can be very monotonous and detrimental to learning. Thus, it is a good idea to experiment with changing your learning settings every now and then. You might want to learn one topic in one corner of the room and another at some other place. Even the way you learn can be refreshed. One of the top study tips is to be energized and active which new surroundings can bring to you.Another benefit will be that when you move from one surrounding to another, you will also get physically active which will lead to better health outcomes as well.The above mentioned study tips are all quite effective and drive great results. However, implementing all of them together might be too much of an overkill. Thus, it is best that you start with one or two tips at a time, seamlessly integrate them in your schedule and move onto the next one. The bottom line is don’t blindly follow these tips because they are best practices. Rather, see what works for you personally and can help improve your grades.Your email address will not be published.

117,https://buymeonce.com/blogs/articles-tips/7-tips-for-taking-care-of-your-skin-in-winter,"Posted By Jana PleytoHere at BuyMeOnce we believe in taking brilliant care of your possessions so that they serve you well for a lifetime, and your skin is no exception. Harsh winter weather can be damaging, uncomfortable and downright painful on your skin. Whilst there are some brilliant skincare brands out there (our favorite is Neal’s Yard by a mile) many products are superfluous, and can even do more harm than good.Hard as it might be, resist that urge to panic-buy cupboard-fulls of lotions and potions following that first gust of bitterly cold winter wind! This mix of hydrating, natural products, home remedies and top tips to live by will keep your skin healthy, happy and glowing through the whole winter.When it’s cold outside we often forget to drink enough water throughout the day, but this is just when low humidity is most likely to strip our poor skin of its moisture. Remember to sip slowly through the day rather than gulp and to use a reusable bottle - our favourite is this one by Klean Kanteen. Indulging in warming winter teas such as natural ginger and lemon is a wonderful way to keep hydrated in winter - you will feel healthy, hydrated and cozy at the same time. It’s a win-win situation!Many high street cleansers actually contain harsh chemicals which can be damaging rather than nourishing. Ingredients such as alcohol and any added fragrances won’t do any favors for dry, cracked skin, as they strip away natural oils. Cream-based cleansers such as this Neal's Yard Frankincense one will help keep the moisture in, while still takingoff the day’s dirt and make-up.It may be the last thing on your mind when you have dry, itchy skin, but there are benefits to exfoliating your skin during winter. Not only will it take off the dry, dead skin cells, but it also helps you regenerate new ones. Your skin will thank you for using natural, exfoliating scrubs like this yummy-smelling geranium and orange scrub, or even check out this list of five homemade recipes that are easy to make using just ingredients from your kitchen pantry!It’s tempting to reach for that dial and turn up the heat and have a long, hot shower or a bath when it’s cold outside. However, hot showers and long baths are a big no-no. Not only will excessively hot water dehydrate you, but it will also strip away those necessary oils from your body. If you come out of the shower and your skin is irritatingly red and itchy, it’s a sign that you’ve overdone it. All is not lost though. We’ve got you covered in the next step.Choose your facial moisturizer and body lotion carefully. We recommend oil based products rather than water based to keep important hydrating oils in your skin. Apply moisturizer or lotion immediately after washing to lock in as much moisture as possible, and don’t forget to include your hands and your feet, the most hardworking parts of your body! Our favorite for your body? This heavenly body butter is a blend of organic butters and oils, topped up with a therapeutic blend of aromatic essential oils. If you recently ran out of body lotion, look inside your pantry for a tub of coconut oil; beauty editors swear by this versatile pantry essential! Winter is undoubtedly harsher on your skin than summer. Out in the open, we may have the pocket essential lip balm to take care of dry, chapped lips, but we need more than that. The combination of low humidity plus those strong, blistering winds can lead to uncomfortably dry skin, so remember to wrap up. A scarf and gloves are essential to protect your hands and the delicate skin on your neck; we love these scarf and gloves by Ally Bee that are made out of super soft alpaca and sheeps wool for minimal irritation.On the topic of skin irritation, a lot of cold-weather clothing can be uncomfortable when worn in direct contact with your skin. We recommend using natural, breathable base layers, such as the ones offered by The White T-Shirt Company, to protect you from any rough or scratchy winter fabrics that are aggravating to your skin when worn alone.We may reach for the sunscreen automatically during the warmer months, but sunscreen is just as important during winter to shield from those harmful UVs. Make sure to cover your face, neck and hands (if they are exposed), and opt for a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 protection. If you’re up on the slopes, the Skin Cancer Institute recommends reapplying your sunscreen every two hours and immediately after heavy sweating. Don’t forget the spots that are easily missed such as the back of the neck, lips, ears and under the chin!Posted By Jasmine VorleyPosted By Jana PleytoPosted By Jana Pleyto",7.0675,10,5.43,9.25,3.59,803

Skin care is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy[1] and ultrasonic skin treatment.[2] Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.[3]
Skin care is a part of the treatment of wound healing, radiation therapy and some medications.
Skin care is at the interface of cosmetics,[4] and dermatology, a traditional medical discipline;[5] there is some overlap with each of these topics.[citation needed]
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams), although some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.[4][6]
Skin care differs from dermatology, as traditionally practiced, by its additional but less medical scope and by its inclusion of non-physician professionals, such as estheticians and wound care nursing staff.[1][7] Skin care includes modifications of individual behavior and of environmental and working conditions.[7] Nevertheless, dermatology has co-opted some aspects of skin care, particularly in the U.S., and to a significantly lesser extent elsewhere, such as the U.K.[1] Add from[1][3][8][9]
[10]
Guidelines for neonatal skin care have been developed. Nevertheless, the pediatric and dermatological communities have not reached consensus on best cleansing practices, as good quality scientific evidence is scarce.[11] Immersion in water seems superior to washing alone, and use of synthetic detergents or mild liquid baby cleansers seems comparable or superior to water alone.[11] Add from [12][13]
Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and increased risk of skin cancer.[14] UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin.It can even reduce skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation. 
Sunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, and at least a tablespoon (25 ml) should be applied to each limb, the face, chest, and back, to ensure thorough coverage. Many tinted moisturizers, foundations and primers now contain some form of SPF.
Sunscreens may come in the form of creams, gels or lotions; their SPF number indicates their effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's radiation. There are sunscreens available to suit every skin type; in particular, those with oily skin should choose non-comedogenic sunscreens; those with dry skins should choose sunscreens with moisturizers to help keep skin hydrated, and those with sensitive skin should choose unscented, hypoallergenic sunscreen and spot-test in an inconspicuous place (such as the inside of the elbow or behind the ear) to ensure that it does not irritate the skin.
Skin ageing is associated with increased vulnerability.[15] Skin problems including pruritus are common in the elderly but are often inadequately addressed.[16] A literature review of studies that assessed maintenance of skin integrity in the elderly found most to be low levels of evidence,[15] but the review concluded that skin-cleansing with synthetic detergents or amphoteric surfactants induced less skin dryness than using soap and water.[15] Moisturizers with humectants helped with skin dryness, and skin barrier occlusive reduced skin injuries.[15]
There is limited evidence that moisturising soap bar; combinations of water soak, oil soak, and lotion are effective in maintaining the skin integrity of elderly people when compared to standard care.[17]
According to the American Academy of Dermatology, between 40 and 50 million Americans suffer from acne each year.[18] While many associate acne with adolescence, acne can occur at any age, with its causes including heredity, hormones, menstruation, food, and emotional stress.[18]
Those with inflammatory acne should exfoliate with caution as the procedure may make conditions worse and consult a dermatologist before treatment.[18] Some anti-acne creams contain drying agents such as benzoyl peroxide (in concentrations of 2.5 - 10% ).[19]
Pressure sores are injuries to skin and underlying tissue as a result of prolonged pressure on the skin. A known example of pressure sore is a bedsore called pressure ulcer.
Add from [20][21]
When cleaning the stoma area, plain warm water should be use and dry wipe to gently clean around the stoma. Pat gently and make sure not to rub the area. Put all used wipes in a disposable bag and wash your hands after.
Wound healing is a complex and fragile process in which the skin repairs itself after injury. It is susceptible to interruption or failure that creates non-healing chronic wounds.[22]
Add from
Radiation induces skin reactions in the treated area, particularly in the axilla, head and neck, perineum and skin fold regions.[23] Formulations with moisturising, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and wound healing properties are often used, but no preferred approach or individual product has been identified as best practice.[23][24] Soft silicone dressings that act as barriers to friction may be helpful.[23] In breast cancer, calendula cream may reduce the severity of radiation effects on the dark spot corrector.[24][25] Deodorant use after completing radiation treatment has been controversial but is now recommended for practice.[25] Add from[26][27][28][29]
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are medications used in cancer treatment. These medications commonly cause skin and nail problems, including rashes, dry skin and paronychia.[30] Preventive intensive moisturising with emollient ointments several times, avoidance of water-based creams and water soaks (although in certain circumstances white vinegar or potassium permanganate soaks may help), protection the skin from excessive exposure to sunshine, and soap substitutes which are less dehydrating for the skin than normal soaps, as well as shampoos that reduce the risk of scalp folliculitis, are recommended. Treatment measures with topical antibiotic medication can be helpful.[30][31][32]
Cosmeceuticals are topically-applied, combination products that bring together cosmetics and ""biologically active ingredients"". Products which are similar in perceived benefits but ingested orally are known as nutricosmetics. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ""does not recognize any such category as ""cosmeceuticals."" A product can be a drug, a cosmetic, or a combination of both, but the term ""cosmeceutical"" has no meaning under the law"". Drugs are subject to an intensive review and approval process by FDA. Cosmetics, and these related products, although regulated, are not approved by FDA prior to sale.
Skin care procedures include use of botulinum;[33] exfoliation; fillers; laser medicine in cosmetic resurfacing, hair removal, vitiligo, port-wine stain and tattoo removal; photodynamic therapy; microdermabrasion; peels; retinol therapy.[1]

This is one bad dream turned into reality that a lot of us have experienced firsthand.In this article, we list some tips and tricks so that you can tackle skin problems associated with the monsoon season. IndiaToday.in spoke to three dermatologists to get the best advice for you and help you get supple and healthy skin.We spoke to Dr Navin Taneja, Founder and Director of The National Skin Centre, Dr Shehla Agarwal, Director of Mehak Derma & Surgery clinic and Dr Suruchi Puri from Medi Makeovers for some valuable advice.Taking Care Of PimplesPimples are our worst enemies. Dr Taneja shared an essential skincare routine for the monsoon season that helps fight acne. ""Wash your face with a pH balanced cleanser 3-4 times a day. Always apply calamine lotion during the day and multani mitti once a week as a face pack. Do not break your pimples. You must use fluid/water-based sunblocks which are specially made for acne-prone skin. Avoid thick creams and moisturisers and also avoid too much oily and spicy food in your daily diet.”Dr Puri also reiterated on the same lines and explained the basic steps of tackling oily and acne-prone skin. Moreover, she elaborated on the importance of the CTM (Cleanser Toner Moisturiser) regime. “For acne-prone oily skin, monsoon can be really troublesome. There can be a lot of sweat on your skin which can block the pores and lead to a collection of dirt. The blockage of the pores can also cause breakouts. CTM regime needs to be continued as usual. One needs to wash the face with a soap-free cleanser at least twice or thrice a day because we want the face to be clean, but we do not want the essential fatty acids to get washed off from the skin. After the cleanser, we need to use an alcohol-free toner because the alcohol might further dry off your skin. The toner, however, should be enriched with some anti-oxidants like green tea or a little bit of rose water or glycolic acid. Something like this can be helpful as a toner and after that, apply a moisturiser which should not be very oily.”Dr Agarwal spoke about prickly heat specifically and explained the correct way to deal with it. She said, “Prickly heat is also caused in this weather due to blockage of sweat pores. To treat it in the most effective way, always ice compress - directly apply ice to the skin. Resent scratching and cut nails regularly as this can lead to a secondary infection.”Tackling Dry SkinNot a lot of people talk about dry skin during the monsoon, but Dr Taneja shared some useful tips. He said, “Wash your face with pH balanced face washes and apply routine moisturisers that have shea butter and vitamin E. Also, apply glycerin over moist skin.”Monsoon Specific Regime For SkincareSpeaking of a specific skincare regimen that could be followed during the monsoon season, all doctors agreed on the importance of applying an effective sunblock. Dr Taneja said, “Take bath twice a day. Wear loose linen and cotton clothing so that the skin breathes and this prevents fungal and bacterial infections. Wear your sunblock three times a day at a gap of every 3-4 hours. It should be SPF 30 PA+++.”Dr Suruchi Puri also had the same advice for everyone. “After completing your CTM regime, use SPF. Sunscreen should not be ignored in the monsoon season. You have to use at least SPF 30 with a triple plus rating and it should provide protection for both UVA and UVB. It should preferably be in the gel form and one should always apply SPF half an hour before going out in the sun. Repeat the application every three hours even if you are inside your home or office. You can also use a natural clay mask once a week.”Monsoon Specific Skin InfectionsAnother thing that is extremely common in monsoons is the fungal infections on the skin. Worry not, because doctors had the solution for this problem as well. Dr Agarwal said, ""Rainy season is a season of humidity and that makes our skin vulnerable to many infections, especially, fungal and bacterial infections. If you get caught in the downpour, rainwater mixed with environmental pollutant makes the situation worse. The best way to get healthy, clean skin in this weather is to be aware of various infections and precautions to avoid contraction.""She added, ""Fungal infections are commonly called Ringworm and the most susceptible areas of the body are skin folds like underarms, groin area, buttocks, feet where sweat collects and if not taken care of, it can lead to severe suffering. People who are overweight, diabetic or have prolonged working hours, especially, are prone to getting fungal infections. Itching rash and irritation are symptoms of fungal infections and the best way to avoid contracting them is by keeping cool and clean.""She also shared several other tips. “Always clean skin folds with a soft towel by dabbing. Apply lots of talcum powder and avoid prolonged self-medication. Do not share towels and combs. Avoid tight synthetic clothes. Undergarments should be ironed to avoid dampness. Shoes should be dried in the sun to prevent infection from occurring again.”Dr Puri added, ""Monsoon also brings about an increased risk of fungal infection. So you need to wear cotton clothes and use absorbent powder wherever you sweat.”Natural Home RemediesIn the age of opting for organic and natural stuff, we also spoke to doctors about the things that we can use from our kitchen on our skin to get that dreamy glow. Dr Taneja said, “To tone up normal to dry skin - one can use papaya pulp. For oily and acne-prone skin, use a multani mitti face pack. And to detan, for all skin types, one can use a cucumber face pack.”Dr Puri added, “If your skin is very oily, you can use besan as a natural exfoliant once a week to get rid of the dead skin.”What To Eat To Get Good SkinIt is not just about what you apply on your face, but also what you eat that affects your skin. On that note, we spoke about the food items that we can consume to make our skin look radiant. Dr Taneja said “It is very important to include juicy and antioxidant-rich fruits, increase vegetables and salads in your diet and take less oily, spicy and greasy food in this season. Drink water to keep your skin hydrated. Nimbu paani, egg whites, milk, buttermilk and curd must be included in your diet. Avoid too much caffeine.”Dr Shehla said, ""To increase the resistance of our skin, one should stay hydrated by taking 10 - 12 glasses of water per day. Consumption of coconut water is also important, as it is rich in potassium and can do wonders for the skin.”ALSO READ | Skincare tips to beat Diwali pollution: Doctors tell you how to make it healthy againALSO READ | Secret to Anil Kapoor's ageproof skin is South Indian food.

Instead of apples, you just need some TLC and the right product mix to make sure your skin remains healthy.Although skin issues like pigmentation, dark spots, and dullness, zits, and dark circles are inevitable due to the changing seasons, that shouldn’t deter you from wanting flawless, soft and glowing skin. Here are some natural skin care tips along with some easy-to-remember dos and don’ts to get natural healthy skin:The first natural skincare tip which you must always remember is to make sure you remove your make-up before turning in for a nap. Your skin needs to breathe and leaving that make-up on before going to sleep can clog your pores, causing blackheads and blemishes. Tested by dermatologists and suitable for all skin types, Kaya Youth’s Oxy-Infusion Face Wipes can effectively remove excess oil, dirt, and makeup from your skin.Wear sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15. SPFs act as good agents in blocking harmful UVA and UVB rays of the sun. Since excessive sun exposure can cause you a lifetime ordeal of skin problems, thus opt for creams that are ‘non-acnegenic’. Kaya Youth’s Glow Essentials Day Cream + Face Serum can be your best pick. It is ideal for daily use and re-application within a few hours to protect your skin against harmful UV sun rays. It goes deeper in your skin layers to boost the oxygen supply and reduce dullness and dark spots, giving you healthy, youthful, and glowing skin every day. It’s lightweight and fast-absorbing and helps treat pigmentation in exchange for flawless skin.If you think you can give the moisturizer a skip, think again. Moisturize well and often. Just because you apply day cream on your face, doesn’t mean the rest of your skin doesn’t need care. You can try Kaya Youth’s 24 Hour Non-Stop Moisturizing Body Lotion that will give you naturally healthy skin with its dermat-created blend of vitamins, moisturizers, cell energizers, antioxidants, and sunscreens. Adding this to your natural skincare routine will also soothe and heal dry skin with its antimicrobial properties and coconut oil-rich formula. The best part is that it is devoid of parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, and SLS, thus making it the best match for all skin types.Nutrient-rich foods with proteins and vitamins are a must. Although, we’re not saying go on a fruit or vegetable diet, infuse fruits and ample of leafy vegetables in your normal diet to keep a good balance. Consider a diet rich in vitamin C, low in fats and sugar to regulate insulin levels. This helps your skin cell maintain a rich and healthy balance. And if you want to protect your skin against inflammation and the effects of free radicals, make sure you are also consuming foods enriched with Vitamin E. Along with using natural skin care products, it is also important to follow a proper diet for naturally healthy and glowing skin. Also, read about the collagen rich food that you must include in your diet.All we’re saying is that beauty sleep can literally result in beautiful-looking skin. Take this note with high importance and try to sleep for a minimum of 8 hours every night. Lack of good sleep can result in eye bags, and not every woman wants that. So lower your stakes. Apply the Kaya Youth’s Under Eye Gel before hitting the bed. Its quick-absorbing Aloe Vera gel will reduce dark circles and revitalize your under-eye skin. This paraben- and sulphate-free under-eye gel contains hyaluronic acid that boosts cell renewal, while the hydro lock complex seals moisture in your skin for upto 24 hours to make you look fresh and young. It’s non-sticky and quick-absorbing and seeps quickly into the skin to repair under-eye bags.Avoid fermented salts, fried, and spicy foods. Excessive oil in your food content can cause an avalanche of skin problems. Thus, the best way to keep them at bay is to opt for foods rich in carbs, omega-3 fatty acids such as rice, sunflower seeds, avocados, and fatty fish such as mackerel, salmon, herring, oatmeal.Don’t forget to sweat it out. To follow a natural skincare routine, a regular workout is a must. However, do not forget to apply a toner before stepping out to minimize oil production. You can always exfoliate afterwards or even use a good face wash like the Kaya Youth’s dermat-crafted Hydrating Gentle Face Wash to remove oil or dirt. Its energising beads offer healthy hydration, making it suitable for all skin types. It’s free from parabens and sulphates, which means it does not impair your skin or strip away its natural oils.
Be gentle on your face while washing it. You may think you’re cleaning it thoroughly, but rubbing too hard is not recommended at all. It can strip your skin of its natural oils and moisture. The result? Skin woes like dryness and irritation. Moreover, it can trigger the skin’s sebaceous glands into producing more sebum and lead to acne breakouts. Yikes!Avoid using chemically-loaded serums and liquids to hydrate your face. Instead, go for the Kaya Youth Hydro Repleniswh Refreshing Face Mist. It not only reduces your eye puffiness but also hydrates tired and dry skin instantly. Just spritz it on at night or during the day for on-the-go hydrationTempted to pop out those pimples? That’s a big NO! The reason being, this can cause redness, swelling and even scarring. If you feel a pimple is on its way, dab the area with our Kaya Youth’s Overnight Recovery Cream which will reduce acne breakouts and pimples with its soothing allantoin and cica extracts. This night cream boasts two-in-one benefits; one, soothing skin irritation caused by face masks, and other, restoring the natural health of your skin 2x times faster. Additionally, it’s free from SLS and parabens and is suitable for all skin types. After that place a cool tea bag for a while. Way to go, girl!Honing your body, looks, and skin is a good thing. But following a natural skincare routine is also necessary. So, be it your late-night soirees or cocktail parties, with a diligent skincare regime in your roster, healthy-looking skin is just a snap away.Also, read about food for healthy skin to give your skin the boost it needs to look healthy and glowing.If you want your skin to look and be healthier naturally, here are a few things you can do: figure out your skin type (dry, oily, sensitive, or combination) and maintain a daily skincare routine that’s suited to it. Never sleep with your make-up on. Protect your skin from the sun. Eat nutritious foods. Use the right skincare products, such as Kaya Youth’s range of products.If you want glowing skin, steer clear of junk foods. Stay away from excessively salty or oily food. It is best to avoid spicy foods as well. To get glowing skin, incorporate the ‘good’ fats into your diet. Foods containing Omega-3 fatty acids such as avocados, fish, sunflower seeds, oats, etc. can really improve your skin health and help it glow naturally.  Taking care of your skin doesn’t have to be too hard, if you know what you’re doing. Figure out a morning and nighttime skincare routine that works for you. Moisturize often. Apply toner. With the help of the right skincare products like Kaya Youth’s range of skincare products, you can take care of your skin too! Not if you want to have a naturally healthy skin. If you skip the moisturizer, you won’t harm your skin directly; however, in the long run it can lead to dryness and irritation. Make sure you moisturize your skin everyday to maintain skin health.

125,https://www.lybrate.com/topic/weight-loss,"The various methods of losing weight are as follows: Adding protein to your diet is one of the best ways for losing weight. High protein diet metabolizes 80-100 calories per day and it also makes you feel less hungry as it reduces your appetite. Food like eggs can also create an impact.  If you want to lose your weight then you must stop eating processed food as it contains high calories and fats. Therefore you must stop eating processed to keep yourself fit and healthy. If someone wants to lose weight then he/she must eat whole single ingredient food. This also helps in eliminating a large variety of fats, added sugar, and processed food. Eating whole foods is beneficial for the body as it provides many essential nutrients in the body which are important for overall body functioning. Taking added sugar can give the most leading diseases which include heart diseases, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. If you minimize the sugar intake then you can save yourself from many diseases and it also helps in losing weight.  It has been claimed that drinking more water results in weight loss. If you drink up to 0.5 liters of water per day then it burns down the unnecessary calories and decreases your weight.  Eating fruits and vegetables is extremely healthy and also help in weight loss. Fruits and vegetables contain fiber, nutrients and water thus you can eat them without gaining much weight.  Eating a low-carb diet is very helpful in reducing weight and also results in weight loss up to 3 times more rather than eating standard low-fat food. If you are overweight or have excessive weight then you can face the following problem: If a person is suffering from type 2 diabetes and is overweight then he/she has to face many problems as it is very hard to control blood sugar level.  if a person is overweight then his/her heart structure gets worse and which can lead to heart failure.The hormones which raise the blood pressure also raise the weight and being overweight also leads to high blood pressure. People who have high weight eventually develop psoriatic arthritis.Natural weight loss tips include:These are the yoga for weight loss: These are the ways in which you can lose weight fast without exercise:These are the ways in which you can lose weight fast:Diet plays a crucial role in reducing excessive weight.

126,http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/weight-loss-tips,"Improving ones grades and performance is an integral part of academic life. Every student is on the look out for top study tips which can help him/her score more while putting in less effort. Most people believe that studying for longer hours is the only way to improve grades and performance. However, the trick lies not in studying more, rather, studying efficiently that reaps maximum results. Ask yourself, ‘If you are able to achieve the same results in 2 hours of study, why would you spend 4 hours on the same”? The idea here is that students must strive to follow study tips that augment their efficiency and not force them to elongate their study time.Table of ContentsA lot of students believe that study tips are over rated and do not have any real world impact on academic performance. This perception is both a myth and a reality. If you search the internet, you will come across many tips and tricks which have no basis and, thus, are unlikely to help improve your grades. However, if you truly make an effort to identify the right tips, you are setting yourself up for success.Why you need study tips for students is easy. These and tried and tested practices which are served to you on a silver platter. However, simply knowing a tip doesn’t guarantee good grades. It completely depends on how well you are able to implement the same as a part of your daily schedule that makes the difference.Now that we understand what study tips are and the importance they carry, it is crucial to learn about the tips that actually work. When you ask around there will be numerous tips that you come across. However, blindly following all will only overwhelm you without creating any real impact. Following are top 7 study tips for students which are highly effective and have been tried and tested by learners across.One of the first study tips for students is to ensure that they do not overburden themselves. Going overboard might get overwhelming, leading to decreased learning. Therefore, it is best to space out your learning. If you try to do all topics at once, you will only end up getting confused, without retaining any knowledge from any topic. It is ideal to take one topic at the time, study it well and then go on to the next one. This is especially true if your topics have any kind of overlap.It is best to have some kind of change between two topics that overlap. Spacing out this way will help you absorb the learning of the first and prepare your mind for what is to come. If you burden yourself with everything at once, you will quickly reach your saturation point and end up worsening your grades.When it comes to study tips for students, this one is very important. While there are certain topics you can just read and excel at, there are others which require more effort. This is especially true to the analytical and objective subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Thus, an ideal approach would be to start your learning by writing. You cannot understand an engineering question by reading it verbally. Once you have conceptual clarity attained through writing, start practicing.Practicing is about solving similar questions to ensure that your concepts are strong and well revised and you do not need to go back to the books time and again. Practicing enough prepares you for the testing stage. Improving grades is not about how well you know the concept, rather how well you are able to reproduce the same in an examination. Testing comes in handy here. Taking tests in a time bound manner will help you manage your time and efforts in a way that plays on your strengths. Thus, you will find yourself with all the necessary resources to improve your grades.Studying in silos can be effective, but at times, there is a need to study with others. This is very true when there are certain concepts that you have grasp over and others which your peers understand well. Therefore, forming study groups is another one of the study tips for students. It works in a simple quid pro quo fashion where you help your friends with some parts of the coursework and they cover the other parts.It might also be a good idea to get support from your family members. If you are learning a particular answer, you can definitely request someone from your family to quiz you once on the same and help you in areas wherever you are going wrong. At the same time, you can seek support for online learning platforms like TutorBin which bring together expert tutors from all across the globe and can assist in your learning. The bottom line here is that support while learning is desirable and should be sought and given.It often happens that when you in mission mode to score well, you lose track of everything else and your health takes a back seat. If you look closely, when you are too involved in studying, you tend to forget eating, drinking or even sleeping on time. While you might think that all the time you save from there, you might put to studying, however, in the longer run, you’re making an unhealthy choice.Thus, one of the top study tips focuses on ensuring a healthy lifestyle while you study. This refers to consuming a balanced diet and keeping yourself hydrated. Without proper nutrition, your brain will not work at its best, causing a slip up while you study. In addition to physical health, you should give importance to your mental health as well. Don’t stress yourself too much and practice meditation to keep all the anxiety at bay.Taking short breaks are important for effective learning. If you study for 8-10 hours straight, what you retain at the end will be quite less of what you actually consumed. Thus, as another important study tip to improve grades, you must take adequate breaks. In fact, you can make breaks as a reward for some learning well done and see it as positive reinforcement. This is not to say that you take a break after every page you cover.What this highlights is the need to give yourself enough time to replenish after an intensive study session to ensure that your learning bears some fruit. If you keep going without taking a break every once in a while, you will hit your saturation point very early on in your study schedule, defeating the whole purpose of following study tips.Being process driven is very important if you wish to improve your grades. It is vital that you have a well thought routine which you follow properly. There is no set routine or process that works for everyone as everyone differs in their learning habits and behavior. What is important is to ensure that you are able to craft a routine and process that works best for you.At the same time, you can explore creating small tricks to help you retain the knowledge you gauge. Acronyms, relationships, mnemonic devices etc. are simple tricks that most learners use and find very effective. Pick up or create tricks that catch your attention and you feel are worth experimenting with.Sitting in the same place, all the time, especially in the wake of the pandemic can be very monotonous and detrimental to learning. Thus, it is a good idea to experiment with changing your learning settings every now and then. You might want to learn one topic in one corner of the room and another at some other place. Even the way you learn can be refreshed. One of the top study tips is to be energized and active which new surroundings can bring to you.Another benefit will be that when you move from one surrounding to another, you will also get physically active which will lead to better health outcomes as well.The above mentioned study tips are all quite effective and drive great results. However, implementing all of them together might be too much of an overkill. Thus, it is best that you start with one or two tips at a time, seamlessly integrate them in your schedule and move onto the next one. The bottom line is don’t blindly follow these tips because they are best practices. Rather, see what works for you personally and can help improve your grades.Your email address will not be published.

			If you've plateaued in your weight loss plan, try these simple, expert-approved tricks that boost metabolism and burn fat — no crazy diets or weird workouts required.Feel like you've tried every fad diet under the sun? Step away from the keto cookbook and focus on making these healthy lifestyle tweaks instead to lose weight, fast.Eating sugary foods might be satisfying in the moment, but they can increase your cravings for more sugary foods in the future — and that only leads to trouble. ""Many foods high in added sugar are also higher in calories and fill you up less than lower-calorie, still-sweet alternatives like fruit,"" says Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, owner of Amy Gorin Nutrition in Jersey City, NJ. But there are still ways to satisfy your sweet tooth without ODing on sugar. ""When you're baking, cut out some of the sugar in recipes by adding in vanilla extract or cinnamon, blend unsweetened cocoa powder into a smoothie instead of honey, top your French toast with unsweetened frozen fruit instead of syrup, and nosh on a slab of watermelon instead of cookies.""It's easy to overdo it when you're eating something delicious — and that's why it's good to focus on foods that will force you to slow down. ""Slowing down can help you check in with your hunger levels. For that reason, I love snacking on 100-calorie packs of in-shell pistachios,"" Gorin says. ""Shelling the pistachios helps you slow down your snacking, and the shells leave a visual cue to remind you of how much you've eaten. Because you're more in tune with what's gone into your mouth, you may be less likely to have extra servings."" In one preliminary study, people snacking on in-shell pistachios ate 41% less calories than those who ate the shelled version.There's a reason you've been hearing so much about cutting meat out of your diet lately. It's not just great for your body, but also a quick way to shed some extra pounds. ""Consider swapping a few meat-centric meals each week for ones centered around vegetarian proteins — or give a full-fledged vegetarian diet a try if that's of interest to you,"" Gorin says. ""Research shows eating a vegetarian diet may boost and speed up weight loss, resulting in a loss of up to 10 pounds."" Gorin recommends topping a salad or filling a veggie taco with vegetarian protein sources like pulses — which are beans, chickpeas, lentils, and dried peas — to give your weight loss a boost. One study found eating ¾ cup of pulses daily led to a loss of close to a pound over about six weeks, versus people not eating pulses daily.RELATED: 36 Top Diet Plans That Are Actually Worth TryingIf you ever needed an excuse to eat more avocados, this is it. People tend to steer clear of healthy fats when they're trying to lose weight, but they might just be the solution. Studies show that by simply adding some avocado to your lunch every day, it'll fill you up enough that you won't be mindlessly munching on junk food later. ""Slice one in half, sprinkle a little sea salt, and eat the inside with a spoon,"" says Alexandra Samit, a Be Well Health Coach at Dr. Frank Lipman's Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in NYC.Fighting constantly with your S.O.? It’s time to address your issues head-on. ""Research has shown that cortisol, the hormone that's released during stressful activity, is linked to fat storage,” says Gina Guddet, couples counselor and co-author of Love Metabolism. “And poor communication between couples is the most common type of stress that you tend to experience.""No need to shell out for pricey boutique fitness classes — YouTube offers tons of free workout routines, like this one from Tone It Up's Katrina.Meal prepping takes a few hours a week, but it's worth it: By getting your meals ready ahead of time, you won't be so tempted to order your go-to Chinese takeout when you're tired and hungry after work.  ""When you plan an entire week of dinner in advance, you're way less likely to go off course and indulge in foods that aren't good for you,"" says Pamela Salzman, a certified holistic health expert and cooking instructor. And since you planned things out, you'll actually get the protein, fruit, and veggies your body needs — and you'll lose weight in the process.RELATED: 10 Fat Burning Foods That Will Jump-Start Your MetabolismAccording to one 2016 study, real talk from your physician may be the push you need to start working towards your goals. Some patients who spent just 30 seconds hearing why they needed to lose weight were able to shed 10 percent of their body weight.Attitude is everything when it comes to getting healthy, and, according to research by Special K, positive thoughts about your body and weight have actually been tied to weight loss.Green tea isn't known only for its cancer-fighting benefits: It may help boost your metabolism, too. People who took green-tea extract three times a day saw their metabolic rate increase by about 4 percent, according to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. (Translation: You could burn an extra 60 calories a day, which equals about six pounds a year!) It may be because green tea contains catechins, which increase levels of the metabolism-speeding brain chemical norepinephrine, says Joy Bauer, a New York City nutritionist and author of Cooking with Joy.RELATED: The Best Weight Loss Apps for Real ResultsWeight training is the ultimate way to burn calories fast. ""A pound of muscle burns up to nine times the calories of a pound of fat,"" explains Richard Cotton, M.A., chief exercise physiologist for myexerciseplan.com. Weight training increases your resting metabolic rate, which is the number of calories you burn while sitting on your butt. What's more, it gives your metabolism an added boost after you exercise, staying in overdrive for up to two hours after the last bench press, according to a study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Strapped for time? Try these quick moves: squats, bench step-ups, lunges, push-ups, pull-ups and planks. In a pinch, just do single sets of 10 for each exercise — you'll get optimal results for the time invested.Yeah, we just told you to pump iron, but you also need to eat it. ""If you don't have enough of this mineral, your body can't get enough oxygen to your cells, which slows down your metabolism,"" explains Samantha Heller, R.D., a nutritionist at the New York University Medical Center. Most multivitamins contain around 18 mg (the RDA for adults); you can also get your fill by eating three to four daily servings of foods rich in iron, such as lean red meat, chicken, fortified cereal, and soy nuts. If you're feeling symptoms like fatigue and weakness, ask your doctor to test you for anemia (it's a simple blood test) at your next physical.A new German study found that when you drink 17 ounces of water (about two glasses) within a certain time frame, your metabolic rate shoots up by about 30 percent. Using these results, they estimate that by increasing your current water intake by 1.5 liters a day, a person would burn an extra 17,400 calories a year, resulting in about a five-pound weight loss.Suspect you have a sluggish metabolism? You might have hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, which afflicts about 25 percent of American women — many of whom don't know they have the condition, according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. ""The thyroid gland controls your body's metabolism, so one of the first signs that it may be off is an inability to lose weight,"" explains Pamela Peeke, M.D., professor of medicine at the University of Maryland and author of Fight Fat After Forty. Your doctor can determine if you're suffering from hypothyroidism by running a blood test. If you do have an underactive thyroid, you'll be treated with a synthetic thyroid supplement, which you will need to take for the rest of your life (it will return your metabolism to normal, so it should be easier to drop unwanted pounds).RELATED: 30 of the Best Snacks for Weight LossWant to keep your favorite meals from going straight to your hips (thighs, belly)? Wash them down with water, not wine. Alcohol slows your metabolism by depressing the central nervous system. A British study found that when alcohol was added to a high-fat, high-calorie meal, less dietary fat was burned off and more was stored as body fat.It is possible to do more in less time — at least when it comes to your workouts. By incorporating interval training — that means bursts of high-intensity moves — you’ll give your metabolism a huge boost, says Glenn Gaesser, Ph.D., director of the Kinesiology Program at the University of Virginia and author of The Spark. If you usually jog at a consistent pace, try adding a 30-second to one-minute sprint every five minutes, or, if you’re on a treadmill, change up the incline for one-minute intervals.Speaking of intervals, high-intensity interval training (otherwise known as HIIT) has been shown to be incredibly effective for weight loss. Because the workouts are so intense, you don't need to put in an hour — or even 30 minutes — at the gym. According to the American College of Sports Medicine, seven minutes is all you need to get in the best shape of your life.Women who ate low-fat dairy products, such as non-fat yogurt and low-fat cheese three to four times a day lost 70 percent more fat than low-dairy dieters, according to a study published in the journal Obesity Research. ""Calcium serves as a switch that tells your body to burn excess fat faster,"" explains study author Michael Zemel, M.D., director of the Nutrition Institute at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Sorry, but you won't reap the same benefits from calcium-fortified O.J. Research shows that you get the best results from dairy products themselves, not fortified foods. Aim for 1,200 mg, which includes about three servings of dairy a day.Are you like Old Faithful when it comes to your morning walk or evening jog? Know this: The more you do an activity, the more your body adapts to it, so you burn fewer calories. If you want to light a fire under your metabolism, consider cross-training. For example, if you normally walk, try biking instead. ""Since you're not used to working all those different muscles, it's a more intense workout, which can translate into a greater metabolic after-burn because your body is working harder to recover and get oxygen to all your tissues,"" says Carol Espel, M.S., an exercise physiologist for Equinox Fitness Clubs in New York City.Break out the lemon wedges: Regular fish eaters tend to have lower levels of the hormone leptin — good because high levels of leptin have been linked to low metabolism and obesity, says Louis Aronne, M.D., an obesity specialist at the New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center. Try to consume three to four servings of a fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna or mackerel, each week.RELATED: The 25 Best Diet and Fitness Tips for Weight Loss From 2016Stress may contribute to abdominal fat, according to several studies, including a recent one at the University of California, San Francisco. ""When you're stressed, hormones like cortisol stimulate your appetite, slow your metabolism down and encourage fat storage inside your abdomen,"" explains Shawn Talbott, Ph.D., director of the Nutrition Clinic at the University of Utah. So what's a frazzled girl to do? ""Find an activity that reduces stress for you, whether it's listening to soothing music or taking yoga, and do it daily,"" advises Talbott.Think peanut butter is only for pint-sized palates? Think again. PB is rich in magnesium, a mineral that motors up your metabolism by giving your cells energy. Aim for 320 mg a day of magnesium: Good food sources include a peanut butter sandwich made with whole-wheat bread (100 mg) or spinach (1/2 cup has 80 mg).One study from the University of Adelaide in Australia suggests you may lose more weight when you work out towards the end of your menstrual cycle, as opposed to right when a new one begins. That’s because the hormones estrogen and progesterone tell your body to use fat as an energy source. ""Women burned about 30 percent more fat for the two weeks following ovulation to about two days before menstruation,"" study author Leanne Redman says.Studies show that eating breakfast plays a part in successful weight loss — almost 80 percent of people who successfully keep weight off chow down on this meal, according to a study published in Obesity Research. ""Your metabolism slows as you sleep, and the process of digesting food revs it up again,"" explains Heller. Aim for a 300- to 400-calorie breakfast, such as a high-fiber cereal (another metabolism booster) with skim milk and fruit.Not in an extreme, Atkins sort of way, but having a little protein at every meal fires up your metabolism. ""Your digestive system uses more energy to break it down, so you burn more calories,"" explains Lisa Dorfman, R.D. However, keep protein levels to between 20 and 35 percent of your diet; eating too much of it can cause kidney strain and may cause your body to store too much fat.RELATED: 30 Not-So-Obvious Foods You Should Eat When Trying to Lose WeightGrazing is a surprisingly good idea because it helps you avoid metabolic slowdown. ""Your body will be tricked into thinking it's constantly eating, so it will never slow your metabolism down,"" explains Bauer. Aim for five small meals (200 to 500 calories) a day rather than three large ones. Also try not to go more than four hours without eating — if you eat breakfast at 7am, for example, have a snack at 10am, lunch at noon, another snack at 3pm and dinner at 7pm.Carb crazy? Consider this: Refined carbohydrates, such as bread, potatoes and rice, create a surge in insulin that in turn drives down your resting metabolic rate, explains Aronne. ""It's important to keep carbohydrates in your diet, but really focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which have less of an effect on insulin levels,"" he explains. And when buying whole-grain breads and cereals, make sure the first ingredient listed is whole wheat, whole oat or cracked wheat.Every little movement counts, whether you’re a leg-jiggler, love a good stretch, or just like to pace. One Mayo Clinic study found that even when natural fidgeters consumed an extra 1,000 calories a day for two months, they tended not to store the calories as fat, unlike their nonfidgety-counterparts.They're full of potassium, which revs up your metabolism by regulating your body's water balance, says vitamin expert Susan Lark, M.D., author of The Lark Letter. If you're dehydrated, you'll burn fewer calories. Make sure you're getting at least 2,000 mg: a banana has 450 mg, a cup of milk has 370 mg and an orange has 250 mg.RELATED: How to Lose 10 Pounds Without Hating Your LifeIf you’re logging just a few hours of sleep a night, you may actually find yourself gaining weight. Researchers at the University of Chicago Medical Center found that subjects who slept just four hours had a harder time processing carbs. ""When you're exhausted, your body lacks the energy to do its normal day-to-day functions, which includes burning calories efficiently,"" says Talbott.",6.82,9.85,4.98,9.03,3.42,2588

How many calories have you eaten today? And how many should you consume if you’re trying to maintain your current weight or lose those last 10 pounds? If you’re like most people, you probably wouldn't know the answer. According to years of surveys from the International Food Information Council (IFIC) Foundation, a not-for-profit health education organization, only about 30 percent of us pay attention to calories when we're looking to eat healthfully.With so many weight loss plans focused on eliminating or increasing certain foods — whether it's through banishing carbs, loading up on protein, or eating “healthy” fats — the benefit of counting calories may get crowded out of the conversation. But you shouldn’t discount this powerful weight loss tool, say experts, because the secret to losing weight for good isn’t eliminating bread or existing entirely on green juice.“Sustained, healthy weight loss comes down to a pretty basic equation: fewer calories plus more exercise,” say Jenny Sucov and Maureen Namkoong, RD, the authors of My Calorie Counter, Everyday Health's nutritional information guide. “By keeping track of how many calories you consume and burn every day, you can slim down, gain energy, and stave off a whole host of health problems.”What keeps people from counting calories? Among the biggest roadblocks people cite, according to one IFIC survey, are the difficulty of counting calories (30 percent), having a focus on other nutrients (30 percent), thinking that calorie counting doesn’t matter (23 percent), and being too busy (22 percent).But counting calories is less time-consuming than you think. Follow these tips to get started:1. Determine How Many Calories You Should EatYour body uses about two-thirds of the calories you consume each day just to keep its systems functioning — your heart beating, your muscles moving. The rest of your calorie intake fuels everyday activities, like walking around, exercising, typing an email, doing a crossword puzzle.To find out your ideal caloric intake, start by calculating your daily caloric needs. The number of calories you need daily depends upon five main factors: your age, sex, weight, height, and amount of physical activity. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends that women looking to lose weight keep their calories in the rage of 1,200 to 1,500 a day.To lose weight, you need to decrease the calories you take in, or increase the amount of calories you burn through exercise.2. Count How Many Calories You Actually Eat and BurnYou can easily cut calories by making small diet and exercise changes throughout your day. Here are a few ways:Breakfast Drink water instead of a cup of orange juice. Calories saved: 112Snack Have ½ cup of sliced cucumber and a tablespoon of hummus instead of a 1 ounce bag of chips. Calories saved: 117Lunch Swap out 2 tablespoons of full-fat ranch dressing for fat-free Italian. Calories saved: 128Dessert Eat ½ cup of strawberries instead of ½ cup of chocolate ice cream. Calories saved: 1303. Get Portion SavvyEven if you can’t or don’t want to tally the calories you eat at every single meal or snack, portion control is an easy way to help you consume fewer calories. “In a world where supersized is regular, it’s easy to undercount your calories,” say Sucov and Namkoong.These tips can help you recognize what a healthy portion looks like, which can help you keep calories in check:Think of a tennis ball. It’s the equivalent of one cup of food, which is the recommended portion for items like pasta, cereal, and yogurt.Don’t eat straight out of the container. It’s a recipe for mindlessly overeating. Instead, measure a serving size of whatever you’re noshing on — almonds, soy chips, or other snacks — and put it on a plate or in a bowl.Use smaller plates. Trick your mind into thinking that you have more food by downsizing your large dinner plate for a smaller, salad-sized one. A healthy portion can look tiny on a huge plate but will seem more normal when you shrink its surroundings.Spoil your appetite with nutritious food. Try eating celery sticks with peanut butter an hour before mealtime, My Calorie Counter recommends. You’ll eat less at the meal and feel more satisfied later.

Posted on Last updated: May 2, 2021 Categories Weight Loss Weight loss is a topic I talk a lot about on this blog.That’s not because I think everybody should lose weight- it’s because it’s one of the most complicated topics out there.How many meals should you eat? Should you cut out carbs? Should you intermittent fast? How much cardio should you do?It can be very overwhelming, but it doesn’t need to be!While it’s not necessarily easy to lose weight, it doesn’t need to be so complicated.I could give you 100’s of tips on how to go about losing weight, but I’ll leave it to the rest of my blog posts to help you out.Here, I just want to give you my top 10 weight loss tips to help make your journey way easier.Let’s get into it.A calorie deficit is the only way to lose weight.No fad diet, food, pill, tea, or waist slimmer can change that.People like to fight this idea (not to mention over-complicate it) because they think this implies that weight loss is easy.Do not get it twisted: weight loss is not easy.But it is simple.There are plenty of different dieting methods out there, and we all have unique lifestyles that make our journies unique, but at the end of the day, it will always come down to a calorie deficit.You can enjoy any food in moderation and still lose weight. Yes, even sugar.It should never be “eat this, not that.”It should be “eat this sometimes, and that other times.” Your approach should always be balanced.Many of us are often looking for lower-calorie alternatives to our favorite foods.Like the above example, bagel thins and low-calorie ice cream can be great additions to your diet if you enjoy bagels and ice cream. But they’re not the ONLY options.Our diets don’t need to be all-or-nothing. You don’t need to give up bagels or ice cream if you love them (who doesn’t?), but you can choose to opt for an alternative to help you stay on track.Personally, I’m not currently trying to lose weight, but I sometimes buy the bagel thins. Why? Because saving calories in certain areas allows me to allocate those calories to other foods.But you bet your carb-loving butt that if I truly want a bagel, I’ll eat a real bagel!It’s all about moderation.A balanced diet sometimes takes making sacrifices, but they don’t need to be sacrifices that make you miserable! Maybe you “sacrifice” the bagel for breakfast and opt for a bagel thin instead to enjoy the Strawberry Shortcake bar at night, knowing the total calories will balance out at the end of the day.Moderation is the name of the game!There is no exact amount of protein, fat, or carbs you should be eating; that number depends on a ton of different unique factors.If you’re tracking your macros, you’re likely going to look for the perfect numbers you should be hitting every day.But I’m here to tell you that those perfect numbers do not exist. While someone can give you general guidelines to follow, there is no hard-set rule saying you should be eating EXACTLY “this many” grams of protein in a day.Try not to get too caught up in hitting hyper-specific goals, because it truly matters less than you think.There are definitely recommended guidelines worth following, and I recommend my calorie & macro calculator I built to help give you suggested ranges for your macros (and I actually explain WHY I recommend those ranges, so you can adjust as needed for your life).In most areas of our lives, we’re able to understand that perfection doesn’t exist. So why do we treat our diets differently?We want to lose 1 pound every single week. If we don’t, we’re failing.We need to hit our calories perfectly every day. If we overeat, we’re failing.We need to workout for an hour every day. If we miss a workout, we’re failing.This pursuit of perfection leads so many people to give up. When you feel like you’ve failed, it’s just so easy to quit.Ask anyone who has successfully lost weight, and they’ll be the first to tell you that not every day leading up to hitting their goal was perfect. It’s about being consistent over a long period.You’re going to miss workouts, you’re going to eat some extra snacks, you’re going to grab a drink with friends, you’re going to celebrate Taco Tuesday and Pizza Friday. That’s the human in you. It doesn’t mean you’re a failure, it means you’re living your life.You need to stop chasing perfection and instead focus on the long term. It’s not about one day, one week, or even one month.Being consistent over a long period of time is going to yield you far better results than trying to have the perfect diet in the short term.Did you fall off track and not stick to your diet perfectly this week? That’s fine! Get back on track and stay focused on the long-term.Life isn’t perfect. It’s going to throw curveballs at you. Your diet doesn’t need to be perfect, either.Follow a program or diet that allows you to live your life and just focus on being consistent with it for the long term.As you may have read, I’m all about the 80/20 rule. Allow 20% of your life and diet to be less than optimal. It will keep you sane!If you’re unfamiliar, the 80/20 rule means eating “healthy” 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time you eat what you want without worrying about the health aspect. Of course, you don’t have to sit down and do the actual math of what 80% of your total calories equates to.As a general rule of thumb, if you eat 4 times per day (3 meals and 1 snack), allow one of those meals or snacks to contain a food that may be less than optimal. Or, give yourself one day per week to eat some foods that you wouldn’t normally eat on a typical “diet.”Results aren’t going to come from trying to adhere to a super strict diet perfectly.They’re going to come from being consistent over a longer period of time, even if that diet isn’t absolutely perfect.You’re going to have some bad days. You’re a human, and it happens. But remember, you do not need perfection. Perfection doesn’t exist.You just need consistency.So you want to lose fat, but you don’t know how many meals you should eat to maximize your fat loss?Well my friend, allow me to help you.Perhaps you’ve heard of the amazing results people get by intermittent fasting and eating only once per day.Or perhaps you’ve heard that you should eat a lot of small meals throughout the day to keep your metabolism working to burn as many calories as possible.How do these drastically different concepts both work? Because everyone has different preferences, and meal frequency has no real effect on fat loss.If you enjoy eating snacks all day long, then by all means break your day up into 10 meals (or snacks, at that point). If you don’t really get hungry all day and would rather enjoy an epic meal 1,800 calorie meal at the end of the day, you CAN lose weight that way.Meal frequency on its own will not affect your fat loss.The only thing you need to worry about is how many calories you are eating (remember the calorie deficit idea we talked about earlier?)If you know you need to eat 1,800 calories to lose weight (just an example for the maths), then it absolutely doesn’t matter how you break those calories up in your day.You just need to eat in a way that won’t drive you totally insane. Dieting is already kind of awful. Don’t make it harder on yourself.Hit your calories and your macros. Stop worrying about how you hit them.You can’t trick your metabolism or do any kind of voodoo magic to accelerate fat loss. Stop worrying that Janet from accounting swears by intermittent fasting. Eat in a way that fits your lifestyle, not Janet’s.Because, at the end of the day, the only effective diet is the one you can stick to.You may very well be making progress without even noticing.It’s safe to say that if you lost 0.1 pounds in a day, you would never notice any kind of a change. Even if that occurs every day for a week, you still wouldn’t even lose 1 pound.If you step on the scale, nothing will be different. You’ll likely look exactly the same. It’s easy to assume that you’ve made zero progress.After 2 weeks, the scale would only be down a single pound. At that point, a lot of people would assume they’ve plateaued and need to make a change.But let’s look at the big picture. If this continues for a year, you’d lose almost 40 pounds.0.1 pounds is progress you would never notice, but it’s progress that is still happening, and can lead to some pretty major results over time.Regardless of how much weight you are losing, you’re never going to see the exact same results day after day- your weight is always going to fluctuate. But when you feel like you’re making absolutely no progress, there’s a strong chance that the progress is just too small to notice right now.It doesn’t mean you’re not making any progress. You just might not see it.A year might feel like a long time to wait for results, but a year will pass you by before you know it. 2020 seemingly lasted forever, and yet, here we are in 2021.Don’t get caught up in short-term, unrealistic goals. Focus on the big picture and don’t get discouraged.It might feel like you’re not making any progress, but wait it out. Flex your patience muscle and watch how it benefits you in the long term.It’s the smallest changes that can end up making the biggest differencesCardio is a great way to burn calories, and it is certainly a great way to advance your overall health.But it’s not the secret to fat loss.I’m all for adding some cardio into your routine to burn some extra calories during your weight loss journey, but I see far too many people taking that way too far.If your calories are already pretty low, adding in a ton of cardio is not going to help you. In fact, too much cardio is going to make you feel awful, as it will likely deplete you of all of your energy.I never recommend more than an hour of cardio per day, especially if you’re already weightlifting on top of that!You can hit your weight loss goals without doing a lick of cardio. Focus on your diet above all else and I promise you will see the results you want.If you want to add in some cardio to your routine, go for it! It’s a very healthy habit to get into.But do not make it the cornerstone of your weight loss efforts.One of the first things I recommend to someone starting their health journey: get rid of your scale.Let’s be clear: Weighing yourself can be a very helpful way to track your progress.If you have a specific goal weight, you’ll want to check in on where you are at from time to time.But in many cases, the scale becomes way more of a source of stress than a source of useful information.Obviously, if your goal is weight loss, then you hope that your weight is going to go down. But there are 2 problems with that..If you want to weigh yourself to track your progress, go right ahead, but understand that it is only one small measure of progress.Focus on things like how you feel mentally and physically, how you look, how your clothes fit, if you’re getting stronger, or how you’re sleeping.These are the things that will help define your progress. The scale doesn’t, and shouldn’t, tell your story.What worked for someone else may not work for you.There is no one-size-fits-all approach to dieting, so we need to stop comparing ourselves to everyone else.We’re all built differently, and we all have drastically different needs. If someone finds success and you follow their plan to a T, there’s a good chance that you are actually setting yourself up to fail.Let’s look at an example of two women following the same diet plan:If they were both to follow a generic plan of 2,100 calories, they would actuallt see completely opposite results.Those 2,100 calories will put one of them in a calorie deficit, and the other in a surplus, leading to weight loss and weight gain, respectively.Even if someone seems to be very similar to you in terms of size & activity level, their needs can still be very much different than your own. Metabolism, activity outside of the gym, body composition, workout intensity…they can all affect how much fuel we need (our TDEE).You need to find what works for you. If you’re not seeing the results you need, you might not be eating the appropriate amount of calories!Don’t blindly walk someone else’s path.If you want results, you’re going to need to create your own. If you take only one thing away from this list, let it be this: you need to stop letting the scale define you.Don’t get me wrong, weighing yourself can certainly be a helpful way to track your progress. If you have a goal weight, you’ll want to check in on where you are at occasionally. But I see the scale doing waayyy more harm than good.The number on the scale means absolutely nothing. There is SO much more to your progress than that silly little number.Here’s something to think about: would you settle on losing less weight if it meant feeling better, both physically and mentally?For me, that answer will ALWAYS be yes regardless of what the scale says.If you decide that you need to lose 30 pounds, you’re going to be discouraged when you “only” lose 20 pounds. It’s going to feel like you’ve failed. But the reality is that you probably look amazing, feel great, and have improved your overall health.That is the progress that matters, not the number.I relate it to my bank account. As a freelancer, my income is unpredictable. I have a goal in my mind to aim for, but I’m not going to get caught up in the exact numbers. If I can live a fulfilled life without having to struggle to get by, I’m happy. The exact number means nothing to me.The same goes for the scale. If you’re feeling energized and confident, your mental health is improving, and your clothes are fitting better, then you’ve made incredible progress. The scale can’t tell you that.For me, one of the biggest signs of progress is how I am feeling mentally. I’d take feeling less anxious over weighing less every single day.Don’t let your weight loss become the sole driver of your happiness, because there is so much more to life. Don’t lose sight of what is most important.

Just ask someone who’s done it.That’s exactly what TIME did in a recent cover story looking at new weight loss science. After speaking to people who had successfully lost weight (after failing many times), it became clear that there’s no best way to go about it. Instead, evidence—both scientific and anecdotal—show that it’s possible for anyone to reach a healthy weight through a strategy that works best for them.Here’s what worked for five people who lost weight and kept it off.“I’ve been overweight my entire life. I’d try different diets, lose a few pounds and then gain it back. When I turned 25, I was 485 lb. and I knew I was fighting for my life. I want to have kids one day and be more active with my husband. I wanted to stop sitting on the sidelines of my own life. At the beginning of 2016, I started tracking my calories, working out and making healthier versions of the foods I loved. Ultimately, I fell in love with taking care of myself. My advice is to focus on each day, not how far you have to go. Weight loss is a journey, not a sprint.”Lexi Reed, age 26, lost 278 lb. in 16 monthsMORE: 9 Science-Backed Weight Loss Tips“Don’t just write down everything you eat. Write down how you feel that day, what is going on in your life and how you feel after eating. After a while, look through your journal for patterns. Chances are you’ll find some. I’m a recovering food addict, and nothing was more freeing than realizing what behaviors or events were triggering my addiction. It wasn’t that I had no willpower; my brain was reacting to certain habits that made it hard for my willpower to do its job. Once I removed those patterns—like keeping cookies around the house—my willpower muscle could finally flex.”Erika Nicole Kendall, 33, lost 170 lb. over two years“You don’t have to eat salad all the time to lose weight. There are so many ways to tweak ingredients and make food you actually love to eat—even pancakes. (Try almond flour.) That being said, the type of food you eat also defines your lifestyle. You can eat junk food and lose weight, but you will probably be hungry all the time. So give yourself an occasional cheat day or reward for sticking to your plan. In the end, you want to lose weight in a healthy way, without feeling like you’re hurting yourself.”Nivedith Renga, age 26, lost 65 lb. in nine months“When I graduated college in 2012, I was at my highest weight ever. I was embarrassed about my weight and what I looked like, and I was terrified of being the person in the gym who didn’t know what they were doing. I sat in my doctor’s office and remember deciding that I was going to do whatever it took, however long it took, to change my life. I tried a variety of different diets that worked, but I felt like I was losing my mind not being able to eat certain foods, and I hated that even though I was ‘losing weight’, I still had a really disordered relationship with food. Food is supposed to bring joy and happiness.I decided to give ‘macro counting’ a whirl. It’s similar to calorie counting, but rather than keeping track of your calories, you keep track of the number of grams of protein, fat, and carbs you eat per day. Following this is what ended up giving me the biggest change overall. I felt like I wasn’t starving myself or depriving myself to lose weight. You have to find something you can stick to. What works for one person may not work for another. Whatever you choose, it has to be for life.”Kelly Rojek, 27, lost 50 lb. in 18 months“You have to make slow and steady adjustments, that worked for me. I measured and weighed food to become more aware of portion size. I wrote down what I ate and ate more frequent, smaller meals throughout the day. I try to include protein in each meal to control hunger. I don’t deprive myself, and I’ve gotten rid of ‘all or nothing’ thinking. People could still look at me and consider me overweight. You have to accept you’re never going to be a willowy model, but I am at a very good weight that I can manage.”Jody Jeans, 52, lost 75 lb. over five years.Contact us at letters@time.com.",7.1425,10,6.56,9.43,2.58,756

There are many ways to lose a lot of weight fast. However, most of them will make you hungry and unsatisfied.Protein SourcesFoods that Boost ImmunityLow-Carb VegetablesAnti Oxidant FoodsAssemble each meal out of a protein source, a fat source and low-carb vegetables. This will put you in the 20–50 gram carb range and significantly lower your hunger levels.Here are 10 more tips to lose weight even faster:Fruits that help in weight lossHow much weight you lose, primarily depends on three factors: your calorie intake, the amount of physical activity you get in and your genes. So, if you have stopped bingeing on junk food, given up midnight snacking and even joined a gym, but your weight remains the same, you are probably missing one or two of the three above mentioned factors. Still if you’re working on factors one and two diligently, you should be able to see results, so don’t wallow in despair. Just make sure you follow these basic rules of weight loss.Create A Calorie DeficitThe basic rule for weight loss is that the calories burnt should be greater than the calories consumed. If you can’t bother with a diet plan, make sure you’re at least conscious of your daily calorie intake. Also, there is a good chance that your appetite will go up as you start working out. But if you come home and binge, you are not getting anywhere. Also, if you starve yourself, you might lose weight too fast and not be able to sustain it.Include Adequate Protein in Your DietProtein helps build muscle mass and muscle burns more calories. So, include healthy protein in your daily diet. Seafood, lean meats, beans, soy, nuts and seeds are all good sources of protein.Don’t Ignore The Inches You LoseBody tat occupies more space than lean muscle. So don’t just measure your fitness in terms of weightloss. If you are eating healthy and working out enough, your body composition is most likely changing. And if the fat is being replaced by lean muscle, you may not lose weight, but you may still lose inches.Change Your Workout OftenYour body adapts to routine. So, if you’re getting in 45 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of weight training – how long have you been following this routine? It is advised to mix up your workout. Ditch the treadmill for aerobics or go for a swim. Do yoga for a few months or join a dance class. The idea is to surprise your body.Modify Your WorkoutAll of us fall into one of these three categories: ectomorphs, endomorphs, or mesomorphs. While genetics plays a big role in how you look, to some degree, you do have a say. Hence, it’s important to understand your body type and plan workouts that suit its special needs, to get the best results.Commit To A GoalIf you are new to the gym, it’s a good idea to get a trainer. Understand what you are doing every day and why. Feel your body change with each workout. Comprehend the strategy and then commit to it.Last but not the least, remember, fitness is not always about weight loss, but when t is, don’t aim to lose more than four kilos a month! It’s a good idea to consult an expert to understand the unique needs of your body.CommentSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

137,https://www.laheartspecialists.com/blog/the-best-weight-loss-tips,"Tip 1: Don’t let hunger deter you from sticking with your diet. Whatever diet you choose — and many different diets can help you lose weight — don’t give up because you get too hungry. When you have diabetes, a diet with fewer carbs (like bread, pasta, rice, desserts, sugary beverages, juice) is also important because you’ll need less insulin. And that can help prevent hunger, fat storage and weight gain. Replace processed carbs like white bread, bagels, muffins or donuts for breakfast with high-protein foods like eggs, or Greek yogurt mixed with chia seeds and berries. You’ll find that you stay fuller, longer. Tip 2: Don’t eat a carbohydrate unless it has fiber attached to it. Fiber helps improve blood sugar control, helps lower cholesterol, and reduces your risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, colorectal cancer and heart disease. Foods rich in fiber include legumes (dried beans, lentils), veggies (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, spinach squash, sweet potatoes) and fruit (apples, berries, oranges, pears). Tip 3: Focus on healthy behaviors, not the number on the scale. It’s easy to get discouraged when you look only at your weight. Replace a goal like “lose 2 pounds a week” with specific mini-goals, like “eat 1 cup of veggies at dinner,” “walk 20 minutes a day,” or “keep a daily food log.” If you’re disappointed with your weight progress at week’s end, reflect on how well you stuck to each goal. Try tracking lifestyle changes, food, exercise and weight in a journal. At the end of each week, check off which new habits are going well and which need more work. “Your health is a lifelong journey,” she says. Tip 4: Make plants the foundation of your diet. Different weight loss approaches work for different people. But plant foods should be the foundation of any diet. Research strongly supports the benefits of plant-based nutrition approaches for weight loss, disease prevention, and overall health. That means enjoying lots of non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cucumbers and bok choy, and fruits like berries, apples and pears. Plant-based foods contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients that help support your cells and reduce inflammation, she says. They also provide fiber and water, both of which help you feel fuller. Tip 5: No foods are 100 percent off-limits. When you label foods as “good” and “bad,” you naturally fixate on foods you shouldn’t eat but typically still crave —and likely will crave more when they’re totally off limits. Feelings of guilt from eating forbidden foods can snowball into unhealthy emotions in childhood, adolescence and even adulthood, she says. Tip 6: Spend your calories wisely. All calories are not created equal. If your diet consists mainly of sugar, saturated/trans fats and salt — all of which can be very addictive — you can develop consistent cravings for dense, high-calorie foods with little nutritional value. Eat foods that are high in lean protein, healthy fats and fiber, and you’ll feel satisfied throughout the day and will rarely get cravings. This will help you maintain a lower calorie level, which will lead to weight loss. Tip 7: Plan tomorrow’s meals today. Planning ahead stops that “grab what you see” panic that sets in when you wait to plan dinner until you’re starving at 6 p.m. Scaring up dinner on the fly is likely to bring less nutritious, higher-calorie choices to your table.

Every student is on the look out for top study tips which can help him/her score more while putting in less effort. Most people believe that studying for longer hours is the only way to improve grades and performance. However, the trick lies not in studying more, rather, studying efficiently that reaps maximum results. Ask yourself, ‘If you are able to achieve the same results in 2 hours of study, why would you spend 4 hours on the same”? The idea here is that students must strive to follow study tips that augment their efficiency and not force them to elongate their study time.Table of ContentsA lot of students believe that study tips are over rated and do not have any real world impact on academic performance. This perception is both a myth and a reality. If you search the internet, you will come across many tips and tricks which have no basis and, thus, are unlikely to help improve your grades. However, if you truly make an effort to identify the right tips, you are setting yourself up for success.Why you need study tips for students is easy. These and tried and tested practices which are served to you on a silver platter. However, simply knowing a tip doesn’t guarantee good grades. It completely depends on how well you are able to implement the same as a part of your daily schedule that makes the difference.Now that we understand what study tips are and the importance they carry, it is crucial to learn about the tips that actually work. When you ask around there will be numerous tips that you come across. However, blindly following all will only overwhelm you without creating any real impact. Following are top 7 study tips for students which are highly effective and have been tried and tested by learners across.One of the first study tips for students is to ensure that they do not overburden themselves. Going overboard might get overwhelming, leading to decreased learning. Therefore, it is best to space out your learning. If you try to do all topics at once, you will only end up getting confused, without retaining any knowledge from any topic. It is ideal to take one topic at the time, study it well and then go on to the next one. This is especially true if your topics have any kind of overlap.It is best to have some kind of change between two topics that overlap. Spacing out this way will help you absorb the learning of the first and prepare your mind for what is to come. If you burden yourself with everything at once, you will quickly reach your saturation point and end up worsening your grades.When it comes to study tips for students, this one is very important. While there are certain topics you can just read and excel at, there are others which require more effort. This is especially true to the analytical and objective subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Thus, an ideal approach would be to start your learning by writing. You cannot understand an engineering question by reading it verbally. Once you have conceptual clarity attained through writing, start practicing.Practicing is about solving similar questions to ensure that your concepts are strong and well revised and you do not need to go back to the books time and again. Practicing enough prepares you for the testing stage. Improving grades is not about how well you know the concept, rather how well you are able to reproduce the same in an examination. Testing comes in handy here. Taking tests in a time bound manner will help you manage your time and efforts in a way that plays on your strengths. Thus, you will find yourself with all the necessary resources to improve your grades.Studying in silos can be effective, but at times, there is a need to study with others. This is very true when there are certain concepts that you have grasp over and others which your peers understand well. Therefore, forming study groups is another one of the study tips for students. It works in a simple quid pro quo fashion where you help your friends with some parts of the coursework and they cover the other parts.It might also be a good idea to get support from your family members. If you are learning a particular answer, you can definitely request someone from your family to quiz you once on the same and help you in areas wherever you are going wrong. At the same time, you can seek support for online learning platforms like TutorBin which bring together expert tutors from all across the globe and can assist in your learning. The bottom line here is that support while learning is desirable and should be sought and given.It often happens that when you in mission mode to score well, you lose track of everything else and your health takes a back seat. If you look closely, when you are too involved in studying, you tend to forget eating, drinking or even sleeping on time. While you might think that all the time you save from there, you might put to studying, however, in the longer run, you’re making an unhealthy choice.Thus, one of the top study tips focuses on ensuring a healthy lifestyle while you study. This refers to consuming a balanced diet and keeping yourself hydrated. Without proper nutrition, your brain will not work at its best, causing a slip up while you study. In addition to physical health, you should give importance to your mental health as well. Don’t stress yourself too much and practice meditation to keep all the anxiety at bay.Taking short breaks are important for effective learning. If you study for 8-10 hours straight, what you retain at the end will be quite less of what you actually consumed. Thus, as another important study tip to improve grades, you must take adequate breaks. In fact, you can make breaks as a reward for some learning well done and see it as positive reinforcement. This is not to say that you take a break after every page you cover.What this highlights is the need to give yourself enough time to replenish after an intensive study session to ensure that your learning bears some fruit. If you keep going without taking a break every once in a while, you will hit your saturation point very early on in your study schedule, defeating the whole purpose of following study tips.Being process driven is very important if you wish to improve your grades. It is vital that you have a well thought routine which you follow properly. There is no set routine or process that works for everyone as everyone differs in their learning habits and behavior. What is important is to ensure that you are able to craft a routine and process that works best for you.At the same time, you can explore creating small tricks to help you retain the knowledge you gauge. Acronyms, relationships, mnemonic devices etc. are simple tricks that most learners use and find very effective. Pick up or create tricks that catch your attention and you feel are worth experimenting with.Sitting in the same place, all the time, especially in the wake of the pandemic can be very monotonous and detrimental to learning. Thus, it is a good idea to experiment with changing your learning settings every now and then. You might want to learn one topic in one corner of the room and another at some other place. Even the way you learn can be refreshed. One of the top study tips is to be energized and active which new surroundings can bring to you.Another benefit will be that when you move from one surrounding to another, you will also get physically active which will lead to better health outcomes as well.The above mentioned study tips are all quite effective and drive great results. However, implementing all of them together might be too much of an overkill. Thus, it is best that you start with one or two tips at a time, seamlessly integrate them in your schedule and move onto the next one. The bottom line is don’t blindly follow these tips because they are best practices. Rather, see what works for you personally and can help improve your grades.Your email address will not be published.

							Losing weight is really hard. Today, there are methods of losing weight, but it is still a constant struggle. If you want to make the best of what your body can offer, then I really suggest that you start losing weight and exercising. Most people do not know this, but losing weight is really essential in having a core body. It is impossible to make a great body if you are not even making an effort to keep your weight in check.

There are the list of best weight loss tips and ideas to lose weight fast. https://kitchenbazarpk.com/obesity/how-to-lose-weight-fast/
					


I’m just coming around to read your story and it’s soooo similar to mine! Low FODMAP foods gives me the best results, but I still end up bloated at the end of the night, just not nearly as bad if I had eating something with high FODMAPS. I’ve also noticed that eating small and slow really helps. I’ve been wanting to try 1stPhorm Greens forever but I know there’s stuff in there that’s high FODMAP...have you noticed bloating after you eat it, or has it improved your symptoms?

							Is literally the BEST weight loss community anywhere. I read it everyday, and I'm also so grateful I found https://bit.ly/2V3FLVS, It helped me not only lose weight but keep it off, hope it helps some others!

Meaning to say, everything that will happen in your life depends on your choice, that's why you need to choose the right path that will make you happy. We are all divided by our preferences and by how we see life. But we should always be after the stuff that makes us happy.

							Nice article! There is best advice in this article to lose weight. I found this article helpful for achieving my weight loss goal. Thanks for sharing.


							I'm planning to lose weight, which is why I'm thinking of hiring a coach that may provide a one on one workout routine. Well, you're also right about the importance of writing a diet plan, and never purchase food that is not part of the plan. I also agree with you that this will be more effective by hiring a dietician.

142,https://greatist.com/health/keto-diet-benefits,"The keto diet involves getting most of your calories from lots of protein and healthy fats instead of from carbohydrates. But why is that good for you?Like all other low carb diets, the keto diet is incredibly controversial. While some evidence of its benefits is promising, more research is needed in many areas. Low carb diets also come with a lot of risks, especially for people who follow them long-term (which isn’t recommended). It’s a good idea to speak with a medical professional before delving into any new diet plan, especially a low carb one.Regulating your calorie intake is important in any healthy diet. But whether “regulating” means eating more or fewer carbs (and what kinds of carbs at that) is still a hotly contested topic among dietitians. A keto diet falls into the “fewer carbs” camp. Carbs make up a significant portion of most people’s diets. Keto enthusiasts maintain that calories are important, but carbs aren’t the best place to get them. Enter protein and fat.Keto diets have plenty of potential benefits and risks. We’ve laid out a few reasons a ketogenic eating plan might be the right diet for you, as well as when to avoid it. Keto diet stans acknowledge how hard low carb eating plans are to keep up. But they also believe that the health benefits and general good body vibes far outweigh having to say no to doughnuts (no-nuts?).Weight loss is one of the main reasons people choose to diet. The keto diet promotes weight loss in multiple ways.Processed and refined carbs can contribute to weight gain. By reducing your intake or cutting them out of your diet, you’re removing a key cause of weight gain.There’s also evidence that a keto diet suppresses appetite. Did you know you get hungry because of hormones your body releases? You do now. Keto foods may make your body release less of these hormones. Researchers in a 2013 meta-analysis looked at 13 weight loss studies and found that people following ketogenic (low carb) diets lost an average of 2 pounds more in 1 year than people on low fat diets. Neat.The key word in the keto diet playbook is “ketosis.” Ketosis is a specific way your body breaks down your food and stored energy for fuel.When in a state of ketosis, your body uses stored fats instead of sugars for energy. When does it do this? When there aren’t a lot of sugars in your blood to break down.This is the crux of a keto diet: forcing your body into a state of ketosis by consuming more fats to break down and holding back on the blood-sugar-boosting carbs. A keto diet may help people with diabetes manage certain aspects of the condition more effectively. In super-simplified terms, diabetes is a chronic health condition that messes with your body’s ability to turn food into energy. You may have heard that the price of insulin is going up and that this is very bad news for people with diabetes. Insulin’s job is to break down glucose and other blood sugars. The bodies of folks with type 1 diabetes don’t produce enough insulin, so they need regular doses of it from an outside source. Some people with type 1 diabetes have turned to dietary solutions to reduce their insulin needs. Some studies have suggested that ketogenic diets may be particularly helpful. Keto and other low carb eating plans lower blood sugar levels, so your body needs less insulin.People with type 1 diabetes aren’t the only ones who may reap the benefits. In a small 2008 study of people with type 2 diabetes, 95 percent of participants who followed a keto diet reported reducing or eliminating glucose-lowering medication in the first 6 months. If you have diabetes, it’s important to talk with your doctor before starting or stopping the keto diet, because the dietary change could have drastic effects on your blood sugar.The keto diet might help lower your cholesterol.Well, “lower” isn’t quite the right term — “balance” is more accurate. When people talk about lowering cholesterol, this is usually what they mean. There are two kinds of cholesterol in your body: high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is the “good” cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is the “bad” cholesterol. Lipoproteins carry fat around your body. LDLs pick it up, and then HDLs take the fat-laden LDLs to your liver so they can be flushed out of your system.A keto diet may help you make sure there’s more HDL than LDL circulating in your body. A 2012 review suggested that the keto diet could boost levels of HDL cholesterol in the bloodstream (although it didn’t dramatically reduce LDL levels).According to some older research, healthy fats can be great for boosting your HDL levels. So it’s not surprising that low carb, high fat diets can help keep cholesterol levels in check. But the key word here is “healthy” — stick to mostly unsaturated fats, found in foods like avocado, nuts, fatty fish, and olive oil. Saturated fats, which are found in butter and many fried foods, can increase cholesterol.While acne isn’t life-threatening, it can be traumatic to live with (especially in adults). Skin conditions like acne can cause all sorts of psychological issues for folks who live with them. Many treatments are available for acne. Some involve creams and medications, and some can be quite invasive and painful. But possible links between diet and dermatology may be helpful in managing acne and other conditions.There may be a link between blood sugar and skin health. Processed and refined carbs can mess with your gut bacteria (the good kind of bacteria that we feed with yogurt, not the bad kind we try to kill with medicine).If your gut bacteria get out of whack, it can wreak havoc on your blood sugar levels. And that can be bad for your skin. For example, research suggests diabetes can cause skin symptoms.As we’ve mentioned, keto diets are pretty darn nifty if you want to rein in your blood sugar levels. A 2012 review suggested that the keto diet might be helpful in managing acne. More research is needed, but results so far have been promising.There’s been a bunch of research into keto diets and cancer treatment. Keeping the carbs low could have a few different effects to help reduce your cancer risk.For one thing, restricting carbs could cause more oxidative stress in cancer cells than in regular cells. This is super helpful alongside chemotherapy and radiotherapy when the goal is to kill cancer cells while leaving as many healthy cells intact as possible. Another benefit of the keto diet is lowering blood sugar levels, which can starve some cancerous cells of energy. During ketosis, your liver burns fat and produces ketones. Because some cancer cells aren’t good at metabolizing ketones, they die when there’s no glucose around for energy.Relying on ketone bodies for energy instead of glucose and unhealthy fats leads to a drop in blood sugar levels. In certain types of cancer, this can result in the starvation and death of cancer cells. The keto diet can have some great short-term benefits. But following the keto diet (or any low carb diet) long-term carries some serious risks, including:It’s generally best to follow the keto diet only for a short time. Your squishy blood pump isn’t the only essential organ that may benefit from a dip into the keto lifestyle. There’s also evidence that a brief carb fast can be good for the brain.A 2012 review of studies suggested there may be a link between ketones and the overall strength and health of nerve cells. This has potentially huge ramifications for the keto diet as a treatment for degenerative neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s. As with many aspects of the keto diet, more research is needed on this, but some results have been promising. There is increasing evidence that a ketogenic diet could help people with conditions like epilepsy manage their seizures. A 2019 review suggests that the keto diet might be a good alternative for managing epilepsy in people who don’t respond to medications. The review also mentions that people have used fasting to manage epilepsy for ages, so the keto diet may be a less restrictive option.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder. It can lead to excess male hormones and cysts on the ovaries (meaning they don’t function as they should).A 2005 pilot study suggested that a keto diet could help with PCOS complications like weight gain or loss, hormone balance, and insulin levels in women who had both obesity and PCOS.More recent research from 2020 also supports the keto diet’s use as a short-term method of managing PCOS but suggests that more research is necessary on the long-term effects. Carbs aren’t inherently bad. We all need some carbs. The reason they crop up so much in discussions about diet is that the diet of the average person in the United States contains way more unhealthy carbs than it should.However, cutting or severely reducing your carb intake can lead to all sorts of problems. Low carb diets like the keto diet may be helpful for treating certain conditions. But they can also contribute to health problems, including:Keto diets are risky and still largely underresearched. Always consult a medical professional before starting a keto diet. Keto diets can support diabetes management, but they can also trigger a condition called ketoacidosis in folks with diabetes.Having too many ketones in your body can increase the acidity of your blood, leading to ketoacidosis. Without treatment, this can be fatal, because the acidic blood damages pretty much all of your organs. If you just said “yikes,” you’re correct.Ketoacidosis usually affects only people with diabetes. But some people without diabetes have also experienced it, so it’s important to be on the lookout for symptoms if you’re on the keto diet. Despite its name, keto flu isn’t an illness you can catch. “Keto flu” is the common term for a bunch of symptoms some people experience when entering a state of ketosis (which is the goal of a keto diet). These symptoms can feel a lot like the common flu.If you have any of the following symptoms after starting your keto diet, there’s a good chance you’re going through keto flu:Keto flu can occur anywhere from 2 days to a week after starting the diet. It’s not a diagnosable condition in itself, but many people have dealt with it, and plenty of guidance and advice is available to help you get through it.Keto flu typically lasts about a week. If you find yourself experiencing keto flu, the best advice we can give is to put a pause on your keto diet and speak with a doctor or a registered dietitian.It’s best not to start a keto diet unless you speak with a medical pro beforehand. If they give you the go-ahead, be sure to follow their advice to the letter. If you fall into any of the following categories, you should probably avoid keto unless the benefits severely outweigh the risks:Certain medications just don’t mix with a keto diet. Your doc will be able to tell you if any of the medications you’re taking will react negatively to ketosis or a low carb intake.If you’re on any of the following meds, a keto diet probably isn’t a viable option: A keto eating plan might help you lose weight and manage some health conditions — but some of the diet’s benefits are backed by more research than others.The keto diet is incredibly controversial. The risks increase when you follow the diet for a long time or have a health condition like diabetes.If the keto diet is right for you, it may provide huge benefits when done in a healthy way and in the short term. But don’t start a keto diet without getting the OK from a doctor or a registered dietitian.

But minimalism as a lifestyle doesn’t have to be any of those things! In today’s post, I’m sharing 11 simple minimalist lifestyle tips to help you explore minimalism and start creating a version of a minimalist lifestyle that feels right for you!These minimalist lifestyle tips give you some suggestions of ways to begin exploring minimalism. They let you ease into a minimalist lifestyle by trying out a few ways to simplify your home and your life.This post contains affiliate links. Click here for our full disclosure policy.Minimalism is about so much more than just decluttering
your stuff. It’s about a lot more than just the physical stuff you own in
general!At its core, minimalism is about designing a life centred around whatever you value most. Then removing anything that distracts you from living that life.“Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from it.” ~ Joshua BeckerThe kind of minimalism I’m taking about is a lifestyle, not a design style. It’s about creating an intentional life and making thoughtful choices about what fills your time and space.“Minimalism is not about having less. It’s about making room for more of what matters.”~ unknownMinimalism doesn’t have to be extreme or an “all or nothing” way of living. You can design your own version of minimalism that works for you, your lifestyle and your preferences. You don’t have to get rid of everything you own, live out of a backpack or paint your entire house white.(Although you can if that’s the version of minimalism you
want to live!)Instead, minimalism is about getting rid of the clutter,
the excess, the distractions and the unimportant from your home and your life.
So you have more time, energy and attention for what is important to you.“Minimalism isn’t about removing the things you love. It’s about removing the things that distract you from the things you love.” ~ Joshua BeckerYou don’t have to dive into minimalism all at once if you don’t want to. There are simple ways to ease into and test out a minimalist lifestyle to see what works, what doesn’t and how it makes you feel.In today’s post, I’m sharing 11 simple minimalist lifestyle tips to help you do just that.These minimalist lifestyle tips are some of my favourite ways
to add more minimalism to your life. But in an easy-going, stress-free kind of
way.You don’t have to do all 11 minimalist lifestyle tips at
once, or even try all 11 at all! Pick whichever tips speak to you, and give
them a try. Use them to explore a minimalist lifestyle and see how it feels to
simplify your life!If the concept of minimalism is about removing the clutter and distractions so you can focus on what matters most to you, the key is knowing exactly what it is you value most.This may seem obvious, but sometimes we don’t see the forest through the trees in our lives. We are so focused on the day to day things that we need to do every day, that it can be easy to lose sight of our goals and priorities. Or maybe it’s just a matter of not always keeping our priorities at the forefront of our life….because sometimes life gets busy or distracting!Get really clear about what your priorities and goals are
in your life, both short-term and long-term. Then, once you are really clear about
your priorities, you can make decisions and lifestyle choices that keep your
priorities prioritized!These priorities become your WHY that drives your simplifying journey.For example, maybe spending time with your family is your
priority. Or it could be advancing in your career or building a business. It
could be achieving financial freedom or getting out of debt. Taking better care
of yourself could be your priority. Or maybe it’s having the ability to travel
more.Your priorities will be personal and unique to you. There
is no right or wrong answer. It’s about getting clear about what matters most
to you.None of us can prioritize all the things, all the time.
It’s about making choices about what your short-term and long-term priorities
are for you, right now.Now that you are clear about what your priorities are,
the next minimalist lifestyle tip to help you explore minimalism is to do a
life audit.This means taking a look at what is currently filling your life – both your time and space – and identifying what is getting in the way of you prioritizing your priorities.This step isn’t necessarily about taking action and changing the things that aren’t working to support your priorities at this time. Instead, it’s about identifying and becoming more aware of the things that aren’t working that you may want to change in the future.Even though you may not be able to change these things
right away, you can start paying attention. It’s a practice of starting to
notice what is adding value to your life, and what’s not adding value because
it’s adding clutter, stress, distraction, etc. to your life.For example, maybe you want more time to spend with your family, but notice a big chunk of your time is spent cleaning and picking up your house. Decluttering your house, or even downsizing to a smaller home may be ways to help prioritize time with your family in the future.Doing a life audit isn’t just about what isn’t working.
It’s equally important to identify the aspects of your life that are working
and helping you focus on your priorities. This helps you identify the things
that are worth continuing because they help support your priorities.For example, if one of your priorities is taking good
care of yourself, and you’re currently making it a priority to exercise multiple
times a week, that’s a great thing! And definitely something to continue
because it supports your priorities.Focusing on the positive aspects of your life can help
keep your spirits up and your momentum going as you move towards designing a
life focused on what you value most.Of all the minimalist lifestyle tips in this post, this
is probably the one you were expecting the most.Clearing the physical clutter from your home is an important part of a minimalist lifestyle. And while decluttering your home is simple in theory (keep the things you use or love, get rid of what you don’t) it’s not always so easy in practice.The things we own hold emotional value to us. We may feel sentimental about things. Or feel guilty getting rid of them because they were gifts or expensive to buy. And sometimes the sheer amount of work to clear the clutter from your home may feel overwhelming.The key to remember is that every time you remove a piece of clutter from your home, you’re making progress towards decluttering and simplifying your home.You can declutter your home quickly if that works for you. Or declutter at a slow and steady pace.My favourite way to start decluttering is by starting with some smaller, easier decluttering projects to help build your momentum, confidence and decluttering skills as you go.Another great way to start decluttering is by removing duplicate items from your home. Removing duplicates often feels easier and safer because you’re not really giving anything up. You’ll still have the item, just not duplicates of the same item!The key is making an effort to remove some of the clutter, the excess and the distractions from your home to help simplify your physical space.Removing the clutter from your home is important. But you’ll
never make lasting change clearing the clutter from your home and your life if
you keep bringing in more and more stuff.Start practicing making more thoughtful and intentional purchases to help slow the inflow of stuff coming into your space. Making more intentional purchases helps you buy fewer things overall. And hopefully helps you buy things that will add lasting value to your life, not just end up as clutter!It’s also important to act as a gatekeeper of your home to keep clutter from entering in the first place! It’s a lot easier to keep clutter from ever entering your home, to begin with, than having to declutter and remove it later.Even something as simple as sorting and dealing with mail
as soon as it comes in can be an easy way to cut down on clutter in your home.Equally as important as removing the physical clutter
from your home, is removing the mental clutter from your life.Mental clutter is anything that adds stress or distraction to your life, or doesn’t align with the priorities you’ve set.“Clutter is not just the stuff on your floor – it’s anything that stands between you and the life you want to be living.” ~ Peter WalshFor example, mental clutter could be a to-do list that feels never-ending. Maybe it’s commitments on your calendar you dread or relationships that don’t make you feel good. It could even be an underlying need to be busy to make yourself feel important and worthy.Just spending some time reflecting on what is adding mental clutter to your life is a great place to start.You can’t change what you don’t see. So, identifying what is adding stress or distraction to your life, without adding any value, is important.Then, see if there are ways to start limiting and removing some of this mental clutter.Now that you’re identifying the sources of mental clutter in your life, you can make efforts to limit the mental clutter by being intentional with where your time is going.Remind yourself that it’s ok to say no or set boundaries
to protect your time. You already know what your priorities are. Now you can
make choices to help keep your focus on them so you are actually prioritizing
your priorities.“I will not say yes when my heart says no” ~ Courtney CarverIn her book, Soulful Simplicity, Courtney Carver speaks at length about listening to your heart and setting loving boundaries with your time to protect your own well-being.Another important minimalist lifestyle tip is shifting your focus to noticing and appreciating all the things (both tangible and intangible) that already fill your life.When you live from a place of gratitude and contentment, it helps stop the cycle of always wanting more, newer, better, etc. And instead, helps you notice all the good things that already fill your life.“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more.” ~ Melody BeattieContentment doesn’t mean you can’t continue to strive to improve your life. Having goals and aspirations is important for your own personal growth and well-being. Instead, it’s about learning to appreciate what you already have instead of only focusing on what’s next or what’s missing from your life.And speaking of noticing and appreciating what you
already have, another great way to explore minimalism is making an effort to
use what you already have instead of buying new or more.This is a great way to avoid adding more stuff to your home, especially when it’s not always necessary.Before buying something new, take some time to see if you can use something you already have. You may be surprised how often you can find ways to use what you already have instead of buying something new!One of my favourite minimalist lifestyle tips to help you explore and test out minimalism is by creating one minimalist spot in your home. It doesn’t have to be big, just one area of your home that you keep simplified and clutter-free to test drive minimalism.It could be a clutter-free section of your kitchen counter or clearing off your kitchen table. Maybe you create a small minimalist reading nook in your living room, a clutter-free nightstand or keep your bathroom drawers simple and clutter-free.The key is intentionally creating a minimalist spot in your home to allow you to see how living with less makes you feel. Pay attention to how you feel when using that space and how it impacts your life or makes your life easier.Having some real-life experience living with less is a
great way to spur on a minimalist lifestyle.Decluttering my closet and creating a small, simplified capsule wardrobe is hands down my favourite simplifying project to date. I honestly didn’t know how much stress and burden a closet full of clothes added to my life…until I got rid of most of them!You don’t have to go as far as creating a capsule wardrobe to begin experiencing the benefits of simplifying your wardrobe. Simply getting rid of the clothes you don’t like, don’t fit or never wear will let you begin exploring how minimalism can make life easier.Decluttering your closet doesn’t have to be scary, stressful or overwhelming. Try these simple tips to begin clearing the clothes you don’t wear or love and see how it makes you feel.A wardrobe that only contains clothes you love and feel great in makes getting dressed and starting your day faster and easier. And simply starting your day without stressing about what to wear can have a positive impact on your whole day.I hope these minimalist lifestyle tips give you some
actionable ideas of ways you can begin exploring minimalism in your life.Remember, minimalism isn’t about deprivation or living an
extreme lifestyle. Instead, it’s about deciding what matters most to you, then
removing anything that gets in the way of living a life focused on what matters
most.Which of these minimalist lifestyle tips are you going to try? Leave a comment and let me know!Not waiting for the new year… I’m beginning today! I’m starting over after 20-something years with a hoarder. He left, and I got stuck with his piles and bags inside of bags inside of boxes. Keeping useless junk for its potential use. I’m finally free to put my life in order, one step at a time, as I transition from a big cluttered house to a smaller place that’s just the right size for me to rediscover myself as a woman after many years of caring for husband, children, grandchildren and my mother. I’m on my own to rediscover who I am beyond the aforementioned roles. This Minimalist approach and steps will ease me into my new lifestyle.Good for you. It sounds like you have a great mindset to go into this new stage of your life! I hope you enjoy your new home and simplified life. Thanks for reading 🙂I have been working at this for sometime. I am in a neat, finished apartment that I love.  I just completed a long distance move by myself at 69.  I have returned to my home state and continue to think of ways to declutter my life and enjoy the people and things I care about most.  This is such an awesome adventure, innovative and exciting.

Making suitable lifestyle choices may also help men and women prevent some health problems.Here’s a quick overview of some ways to eat better and be more active.Learn more ways to move more and eat better—for yourself and your family!If it is tough to manage your weight, you are certainly not alone in today’s world. In fact, more than 39 percent of American adults have obesity.1 Excess weight may lead to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, and other chronic health problems. Setting goals to improve your health may help you lower the chances of developing weight-related health problems.Your body mass index (BMI) can help you determine if you are at a healthy weight, overweight, or have obesity. BMI is a measure based on your weight in relation to your height. You can use an online tool to calculate your BMI. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is in the healthy range. A person with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. Someone with a BMI of 30 or greater is considered to have obesity.Another important measure is your waist size. Women with a waist size of more than 35 inches, and men with a waist size of more than 40 inches, may be more likely to develop health problems. Men are more likely than women to carry extra weight around their abdomen, or belly. Extra fat, especially in the abdomen, may put people at risk for certain health problems, even if they have a normal weight.Extra weight may increase your risk forLearn the health risks of being overweight or having obesity during pregnancy.Many factors, including consuming more calories than you need from food and beverages, lack of sleep, and low levels of physical activity, may play a part in gaining excess weight. Here are some factors that may influence weight and overall health.The world around you. Your home, community, and workplace all may affect how you make daily lifestyle choices. Food and beverages high in fat, added sugar, and calories are easy to find and sometimes hard to avoid. And they often cost less than healthier choices like fruits and vegetables. On top of that, smartphones and other devices may make it easy for you to be less active in your daily routine.Families. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families, suggesting that genes may play a role in weight gain. Families also share food preferences and habits that may affect how much, when, and what we eat and drink.Medicines. Some medicines, such as steroids, and some drugs for depression and other chronic health problems, may lead to weight gain. Ask your health care professional or pharmacist about whether weight gain is a possible side effect of medicines you are taking and if there are other medicines that can help your health without gaining weight.Emotions. Sometimes people snack, eat, or drink more when they feel bored, sad, angry, happy, or stressed—even when they are not hungry. Consider whether it might be your emotions making you want to eat, and try doing something else to help you cope with negative feelings or celebrate your good mood. That can help you feel better and avoid weight gain.Lack of sleep. In general, people who get too little sleep tend to weigh more than those who get enough sleep.2 There are several possible explanations. Sleep-deprived people may be too tired to exercise. They may take in more calories simply because they are awake longer and have more opportunities to eat. Lack of sleep may also disrupt the balance of hormones that control appetite. Researchers have noticed changes in the brains of people who are sleep deprived. These changes may spark a desire for tasty foods.3  Learn more about sleep deprivation and deficiency and strategies for getting enough sleep.Being aware of food portion size, the kinds of foods and beverages you consume, and how often you have them may be a step to help you make healthier food choices.Visit ChooseMyPlate.gov to learn more about what kinds of food and drinks to consume and what kinds to limit so you can have a healthy eating plan.Consume more nutrient-rich foods. Nutrients—like vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber—nourish our bodies by giving them what they need to be healthy. Adults are encouraged to consume some of the following foods and beverages that are rich in nutrientsIf you're sensitive to milk and milk products, try substitutingConsume less of these foods and beverages. Some foods and beverages have many calories but few of the essential nutrients your body needs. Added sugars and solid fats pack a lot of calories into food and beverages but provide a limited amount of healthy nutrients. Salt does not contain calories, but it tends to be in high-calorie foods. Adults should aim to limit foods and drinks such asEasy snack ideas. Instead of sugary, fatty snacks, tryThese tips may help you stay on track with your plan to eat healthier.How much you should consume each day depends on your weight, sex, age, metabolism, and how active you are. In general, men need more calories than women. Younger adults need more calories than adults in midlife and older. At all ages, adults who get more physical activity need more calories than those who are less active.Keeping your food and beverage portions in check may help you reach or stay at a healthy weight. To learn more about a healthy eating plan and the amounts of food and beverages that are right for you, visit ChooseMyPlate.gov.Talk with your health care provider about what a healthy weight is for you. If you are overweight or have obesity, your health care professional may recommend weight loss. Consider getting help through a structured weight loss program.Experts recommend beginning with a weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your starting weight over a period of 6 months.4 So if you weigh 200 pounds, that would mean losing 10 to 20 pounds. Modest weight loss has been shown to improve health, and it may bring you other benefits such as better mood and more energy.Use a diary to track the foods and beverages you consume. Keep a food and beverage diary that lists everything you consume in a day. The diary helps youMore adults are using different ways to track health habits, including what and how much they eat and drink, sleep, and weigh. Using apps on mobile phones, tablets, and other devices has become a popular way to track and improve health. These apps have many features. If you are interested, look for apps that best fit your health goals and lifestyle habits.If you prefer keeping a written diary, check out the sample food and beverage diary below. It includes a section for writing down what the time was and what your feelings were when you consumed the food or beverage. Writing down your feelings may help you identify your eating triggers. For example, you may notice that you sometimes overeat when you are with a big group, simply because everyone around you is consuming large amounts of food and beverages. The next time you share a meal with a group, think about your triggers and try to limit how much you consume by eating more slowly.Ideas to support your weight-loss efforts. In addition to keeping a diary, focusing on behaviors related to your eating and physical activity level can help jump-start your weight-loss efforts. It can also help you maintain weight loss for the long term. These ideas may help you lose weight.Consuming food and beverages

 that you should move more and sit less throughout the day. You can gain some health benefits if you sit less and do any amount of physical activity. Learn more about the benefits of getting more active.Keep reminding yourself: Some physical activity is better than none.Being physically active may help you start feeling better right away. It can helpOnce you are more active, keep it up with regular activities. That will improve your health even more. Studies suggest that, over time, physical activity can help you live a longer, healthier life. It mayExperts recommend two types of physical activities: aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.Aerobic activity. Aerobic activities—also called endurance or cardio activities—use your large muscle groups (chest, legs, and back) to speed up your heart rate and breathing.Aerobics can be moderate or vigorous. How can you tell what level your activity is? Take the “talk test” to find out. If you’re breathing hard but can still have a conversation easily—but you can’t sing—then you’re doing moderate-intensity activity. If you can only say a few words before pausing for a breath, then you’re at the vigorous level. Start with moderate-intensity activities and then work up to vigorous-intensity activities to avoid injuries.Choose aerobic activities that are fun for you. You’re more likely to be active if you like what you’re doing. Try getting a friend, family member, or coworker to join you. That may help you enjoy activity and stick with it.Try one of these activities or any others you enjoyRegular aerobic activity can help youMuscle-strengthening activity. Strength training (or resistance training) works your muscles by making you push or pull against something—a wall or floor, hand-held weights, an exercise bar, exercise bands, or even soup cans.Try these optionsDoing regular activities to strengthen your muscles may help youExperts recommend at least 150 minutes a week (a total of 2 ½ hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. You can spread your activity throughout the week—whatever works best for you. Studies show that if you spread activity across at least 3 days a week, you can improve your health, reduce your risk of injury, and keep yourself from becoming too tired.If you increase your aerobic activity to 300 minutes a week—instead of the recommended 150 minutes—you may even lower your risk for heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, if you do more than 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, you may even reduce your risk for several cancers.You should also aim for at least 2 days a week of muscle-strengthening activities. To avoid injury, allow at least 1 day of rest for your muscles to recover and rebuild before working the same muscle groups again.You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from regular physical activity. Even modest amounts of physical activity can improve your health.If you have been inactive for a while (PDF, 13.8 MB)
, you may want to start with easier activities, such as walking at a gentle pace. For example, you could start by walking 5 minutes at a time, several times a day, 5 to 6 days a week. You could gradually increase your time to 10 minutes per session, 3 times a day, and slowly increase your walking speed. Building up slowly lets you work up to more intense activity without getting hurt.Be sure to increase your muscle-strengthening activities gradually. Start out 1 day a week at a light or moderate intensity. Over time, increase to 2 days a week, and then possibly to more than 2 days. Increase the intensity until it becomes moderate or greater.Make a plan to stay on track. You may want to try the Move Your Way interactive activity planner that lets you set your own weekly goals, choose the activities you want to do, and get personalized tips to help you stay motivated.You can keep an activity log to track your progress, such as the sample log below or an app on your mobile device. After you do an activity, write down how you were feeling while you were active. As you become more fit over time, try to slowly increase your pace, the length of time you are active, and how many days of the week you are active.Try these activities to add more movement to your daily life.Many people feel stress in their daily lives. Stress can cause you to overeat, feel tired, and not want to be active. Healthy eating and regular physical activity may help offset the effects of stress.Try some of these other ideas to help relieve stress and stay on track with improving your health.There are apps that give helpful tips on stress management practices and help you monitor the situations that prompt stress.

148,https://expertphotography.com/lifestyle-photography-tips/,"You can also select your interests for free access to our premium training:Lifestyle photography has an almost photo-journalistic reputation. This is where interactions were candid and without any direction from the photographer.
So, what is lifestyle photography nowadays? It’s somewhere between true documentary photography and classic portraiture. Read on for all the lifestyle photography tips you’ll need to capture stunning images.
Lifestyle photography captures portraits and real-life events. Day to day interactions are the best way to tell the story of the moment.
Don’t overplan client interactions during lifestyle photo shoots.
This doesn’t mean your photo shoots shouldn’t have a structure. But a lifestyle shoot needs a different approach than portrait photography.
Take the time to understand your clients. Ask about their likes and dislikes. Ask about activities they do as a family, places they like to hang out. And what they do for fun.
Once you understand them, suggest activities that are a natural fit. This way clients are doing something they enjoy. They’re not worrying about the camera during the lifestyle shoot.
This family wanted to capture photos with their teenage kids. As it is with older kids, the interactions were casual.
The setting was the city where the kids go to college. Understanding the family’s needs made it easy to pick this location.This tip goes hand in hand with the first one. Don’t be afraid to give directions on how you would like the environment to be.
Let’s be honest. Very few of our clients are completely at ease in front of the camera. It is our job as lifestyle photographers to make them feel relaxed.One way to do this is to give clear directions on what you are looking for. But be careful not to be restrictive. I always tell my clients the end result of what I want. Other than that, how they get there is up to them.
In the picture above, I wanted to capture father and daughter interactions. I asked the dad to imagine they are at the park and play with his daughter.
The end goal was to make her laugh out loud. From there on, I captured them giggling, laughing and interacting. This made it easy for me to get the result I want.My style is a mix of documentary and classic portrait photography. One way I do this is to capture the in-between moments, too.
Candid photos are a beautiful way to show the true personality of your clients.
I cheat a little and tell my clients that I am testing the lighting. That way, they’re interacting in a casual, normal manner.
My favourite moments from a session are usually these in-between shots. My goal is to make the clients feel so comfortable they forget I am there.
Some say a client is never comfortable during lifestyle photo shoots. I can understand that line of thinking. But I also know that, as a photographer, I want my clients to trust me, my work, and my style.
At the end of the day, I want them to love their photos. And feel like their photos are an extension of themselves. They’re precious memories they will be able to cherish.A great story has a strong beginning, middle and end. It also has enough details that take the viewer on a journey. It’s as if they were experiencing that story for themselves.
A huge part of giving a sense of place and space is to capture the details. This does not always mean the clothes, accessories and props.
Details are important to the client and help tell the story. No matter what the story is.Lifestyle photography is quite fast-paced. You are trying to capture a scene as it is playing out in front of you.
You don’t have the time or the opportunity to re-compose the shot and then click the shutter.
This does not mean that you have to fire away at the max fps (frames per second) that your camera can handle. And then hope you can make the best of the lot in post-processing.
Instead, use your technical and artistic skills to read the scene. Analyse the light and assess the right camera settings. Imagine the outcome and then take the picture.
Bear in mind that it’s not a good idea to keep asking your clients to ‘re-do’. They will get distracted and might stop trusting your skills.
Any photographer who works with kids knows that things can get very unpredictable. And they can move very fast.
In the picture above, I asked the mom to hug her daughter.
Mom picked her up instead, and this happened. One of my favourite photos of all time. And I didn’t have even a second to prepare.
Today most photographers associate lifestyle with family photos.
You can apply all these tips to lifestyle family photography. But lifestyle portrait photography tricks work with other types of photography too. With some variation and adjustment, of course.When travelling, try and capture candid shots of people and places. Engage with the locals and photograph them in their element.
Are you travelling with a group? Capture the in-between moments of travel in an unrehearsed way. This tells the story of your adventure from start to finish.
Focusing on the in-between will also help with verbalising the story. This is great if you want to submit your photos to travel blogs or magazines.You might get clients who want a documentary approach to their wedding photos.
Weddings tend to be very stressful events for almost all parties concerned. There are plenty of opportunities where everyone wants to take a break and relax. These are the moments you want to capture.
I find most of my lifestyle shots and wedding photos in those in-between moments.These days, fashion photography is leaning towards a lifestyle approach. Brands are finding that people relate better to lifestyle images.
This means models interacting with the environment. This is more realistic than in-studio fashion editorials.
More and more brands are investing in an editorial that revolves around a storyline. The products appear natural in the scene.
They take the viewer on a story of the product.I’m sure you were wondering ‘how do I become a lifestyle photographer?’. I hope these tips helped you give an answer to this question. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to approach it.
This genre is a great way to let your creativity flow. Keep in mind to take cues from your clients.
At the end of the day, clients want images that truly reflect who they are. It is not about the clothes they’re wearing or the location they’re in.
Instead, lifestyle photography is about relationships. As a lifestyle photographer, you get to capture the interactions that matter.Want to learn more about capturing amazing photographs?

151,https://expertphotography.com/lifestyle-photography-tips/,"You can also select your interests for free access to our premium training:Lifestyle photography has an almost photo-journalistic reputation. This is where interactions were candid and without any direction from the photographer.
So, what is lifestyle photography nowadays? It’s somewhere between true documentary photography and classic portraiture. Read on for all the lifestyle photography tips you’ll need to capture stunning images.
Lifestyle photography captures portraits and real-life events. Day to day interactions are the best way to tell the story of the moment.
Don’t overplan client interactions during lifestyle photo shoots.
This doesn’t mean your photo shoots shouldn’t have a structure. But a lifestyle shoot needs a different approach than portrait photography.
Take the time to understand your clients. Ask about their likes and dislikes. Ask about activities they do as a family, places they like to hang out. And what they do for fun.
Once you understand them, suggest activities that are a natural fit. This way clients are doing something they enjoy. They’re not worrying about the camera during the lifestyle shoot.
This family wanted to capture photos with their teenage kids. As it is with older kids, the interactions were casual.
The setting was the city where the kids go to college. Understanding the family’s needs made it easy to pick this location.This tip goes hand in hand with the first one. Don’t be afraid to give directions on how you would like the environment to be.
Let’s be honest. Very few of our clients are completely at ease in front of the camera. It is our job as lifestyle photographers to make them feel relaxed.One way to do this is to give clear directions on what you are looking for. But be careful not to be restrictive. I always tell my clients the end result of what I want. Other than that, how they get there is up to them.
In the picture above, I wanted to capture father and daughter interactions. I asked the dad to imagine they are at the park and play with his daughter.
The end goal was to make her laugh out loud. From there on, I captured them giggling, laughing and interacting. This made it easy for me to get the result I want.My style is a mix of documentary and classic portrait photography. One way I do this is to capture the in-between moments, too.
Candid photos are a beautiful way to show the true personality of your clients.
I cheat a little and tell my clients that I am testing the lighting. That way, they’re interacting in a casual, normal manner.
My favourite moments from a session are usually these in-between shots. My goal is to make the clients feel so comfortable they forget I am there.
Some say a client is never comfortable during lifestyle photo shoots. I can understand that line of thinking. But I also know that, as a photographer, I want my clients to trust me, my work, and my style.
At the end of the day, I want them to love their photos. And feel like their photos are an extension of themselves. They’re precious memories they will be able to cherish.A great story has a strong beginning, middle and end. It also has enough details that take the viewer on a journey. It’s as if they were experiencing that story for themselves.
A huge part of giving a sense of place and space is to capture the details. This does not always mean the clothes, accessories and props.
Details are important to the client and help tell the story. No matter what the story is.Lifestyle photography is quite fast-paced. You are trying to capture a scene as it is playing out in front of you.
You don’t have the time or the opportunity to re-compose the shot and then click the shutter.
This does not mean that you have to fire away at the max fps (frames per second) that your camera can handle. And then hope you can make the best of the lot in post-processing.
Instead, use your technical and artistic skills to read the scene. Analyse the light and assess the right camera settings. Imagine the outcome and then take the picture.
Bear in mind that it’s not a good idea to keep asking your clients to ‘re-do’. They will get distracted and might stop trusting your skills.
Any photographer who works with kids knows that things can get very unpredictable. And they can move very fast.
In the picture above, I asked the mom to hug her daughter.
Mom picked her up instead, and this happened. One of my favourite photos of all time. And I didn’t have even a second to prepare.
Today most photographers associate lifestyle with family photos.
You can apply all these tips to lifestyle family photography. But lifestyle portrait photography tricks work with other types of photography too. With some variation and adjustment, of course.When travelling, try and capture candid shots of people and places. Engage with the locals and photograph them in their element.
Are you travelling with a group? Capture the in-between moments of travel in an unrehearsed way. This tells the story of your adventure from start to finish.
Focusing on the in-between will also help with verbalising the story. This is great if you want to submit your photos to travel blogs or magazines.You might get clients who want a documentary approach to their wedding photos.
Weddings tend to be very stressful events for almost all parties concerned. There are plenty of opportunities where everyone wants to take a break and relax. These are the moments you want to capture.
I find most of my lifestyle shots and wedding photos in those in-between moments.These days, fashion photography is leaning towards a lifestyle approach. Brands are finding that people relate better to lifestyle images.
This means models interacting with the environment. This is more realistic than in-studio fashion editorials.
More and more brands are investing in an editorial that revolves around a storyline. The products appear natural in the scene.
They take the viewer on a story of the product.I’m sure you were wondering ‘how do I become a lifestyle photographer?’. I hope these tips helped you give an answer to this question. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to approach it.
This genre is a great way to let your creativity flow. Keep in mind to take cues from your clients.
At the end of the day, clients want images that truly reflect who they are. It is not about the clothes they’re wearing or the location they’re in.
Instead, lifestyle photography is about relationships. As a lifestyle photographer, you get to capture the interactions that matter.Want to learn more about capturing amazing photographs?

153,https://www.simplyfiercely.com/struggling-with-minimalism/,"Are you struggling to create a minimalist lifestyle? If so, then these powerful (but unexpected!) minimalist lifestyle tips will help you move forward and create real, sustainable change. I’ve considered myself a minimalist for nearly a decade now but if you’ve read my minimalist story, then you’ll know that the road hasn’t always been easy for me. In fact, it took me years to go from “wanting to be a minimalist” to actually following through and making any noticeable changes in my life. It was often a case of one step forward, two steps back. I’d declutter a few bags of stuff one weekend … only to find myself in Target a few days later, filling my cart to the brim with more things that I didn’t really need. It was so frustrating because I knew I was acting against my own best interest! I was tired of settling and I wanted something different for myself but I just didn’t know how to change the habits of a lifetime. It took a while but fortunately, I eventually had a breakthrough moment… The *spark* that changed everything was realising that minimalist living is about so much more than just decluttering—in the same way that healthy living is about so much more than just dieting. Of course, owning fewer things is an important part of minimalism! But binge decluttering without fundamentally changing your mindset is like crash dieting—it doesn’t last and “stuff” will eventually creep back into your life (spoken from personal experience!). I really started to change my life when I stopped thinking about minimalism in terms of what I couldn’t have (a mindset that relies on willpower) and started viewing it as an intentional choice to have more of what matters. I wasn’t giving up anything. Instead, I was taking the first steps towards creating a life I truly love. If this resonates with you, then here are six minimalist lifestyle tips that will help you grow this mindset and move forward on your journey.If you want to have more of what really matters in your life, then you need to start by knowing … what really matters in your life!Spend some time thinking about your values: strip down to the bare bones of your life and ask yourself what’s important? What makes you feel happy, proud, and loved? What fuels your heart and gets you out of bed in the morning?There are no right or wrong answers—it might be family, art, education or stability—everyone has different priorities and that is absolutely okay. Whatever your priorities are, make them your daily focus and use this mindset to frame your minimalist decisions in a positive light. Here are some examples:Master this way of thinking and I can almost guarantee that minimalist living will begin to feel like a natural choice. You probably already know that self-care is important—but did you know that it’s absolutely essential for minimalist living? Consider this: when I’m feeling insecure, worn out or overwhelmed, I find myself going into survival mode. This means I’m not thinking intentionally about my choices. Instead, I’m looking for quick and easy ways to feel better and I end up doing things like:In other words, I make bad decisions. When I don’t care for myself first, I don’t care about anything else—especially not minimalism. I’m not focused on the big picture or thinking about what matters most because I’m just trying to get through the day. The solution? Prevention. Regardless of your feelings on minimalism, I’m a big believer that we all need to practice self-care: drink water, eat healthy foods, make time to read or do activities that nurture your soul, stretch and move, journal— whatever it is that keeps YOU feeling grounded and well.One of my biggest minimalist lifestyle tips is don’t be too frugal—especially in the beginning! I know this might sound like strange advice given that many people turn to minimalism in order to improve their financial situation but stick with me on this one. If you want to stop finding joy in “stuff” then you need to train your brain to see the joy in other things … like experiences! Of course, I know there are a ton of fun things you can do for free (like hiking or museums) but at the same time, I’m mindful that minimalism is usually hard at first. The transition to “experiences over things” might be challenging at first, so do what you can to stack the odds in your favour. Plan trips away, nights out with friends, or unique adventures like wine tours or art classes. Start working your way through your bucket list and get reacquainted with the joy of doing things vs owning things. Eventually, you can cut back and live more frugally (if you choose to—remember that minimalist living does not automatically mean frugal living) but I highly recommend allowing yourself some extra fun money at the start! Have you ever thought:“All I need is _______ and I’ll be happy?”If so, you’re definitely not alone. This mindset was one of the biggest challenges I faced on my road to minimalism. I knew I wanted to own less—but I kept telling myself I just need a few more things first. A new winter coat, a new pair of shoes … there was always something else I needed before I’d be ready to get started with minimalism. (You may recognise this as the “last meal before the diet starts” syndrome!)But of course, as I’m sure you can guess, there was always ONE MORE THING I couldn’t live without. I felt stuck in a neverending cycle. And why was this? Because I wasn’t living in the present. Instead of paying attention to my behaviour and feeling gratitude for everything I already owned and loved, my attention lived in an imaginary future. A fantasyland … where a new dress or some other purchase would magically solve all my problems. I had to learn how to live for today and my mindfulness practice was a big part of that process. I started meditating, gratitude journaling, and doing activities I love such as painting and yoga. Slowly, I began to feel content with what I already had and I stopped feeling like I constantly needed more to be happy. If you’ve read this far, it’s probably because you’re serious about wanting to change your life. And I understand—you were ready for change yesterday— not tomorrow, or next week, or next month. You want your life to look and feel different, and it’s hard to be patient. But let me tell you a story.When I was 22, I rather impulsively packed everything I owned into a backpack and travelled the world for two years. Although I didn’t consider myself a minimalist (at the time, I’d never heard of the term!) I embodied a lot of the characteristics. I had very few possessions and my life was free and light. So with that in mind, what do you think happened when I finally settled down after two years of living on the road?I moved into a gigantic three-bedroom apartment, drove a moving van to Ikea, and turned one room into a gigantic walk-in closet (which I promptly filled to the brim). The moral of this story is that real change takes time. Even if you somehow managed to declutter your entire life overnight, you’d still be mostly the same person the next day. The truth is embracing minimalism is a journey and it takes time to unlearn a lifetime of habits. Everyone’s timeline will be different, so be patient and kind to yourself.Finally, if patience isn’t your strong point (it certainly isn’t mine) learn to reflect and revel in your achievements.Celebrate your small victories: Turn your focus towards how far you’ve come, instead of how far you’ve got to go.This mindset is important because honestly, there is no finish line. Minimalism is about creating space in your life for what matters most and I don’t think this is a task that ever gets checked off your to-do list. Instead, I think it’s a constant cycle of reviewing your values, assessing your life, and adjusting accordingly. It’s a new way of thinking and living—there will always be work to do but there will always be things to celebrate too!

Thank you for the time and energy that you spend for your audienceIs there a way to get the guide& workbook preprinted and mailed to me? Old school in alot of ways. Minimalism interests me on a deep level. Thank you for your time.Hi Barbara, I’m sorry—because it’s a free guide I don’t have the resources to print and post it, especially because I live in Australia.  Perhaps you can download it and have someone else print it locally? Take care 🙂Thank you for encouraging me to pursue what really matters in my life and sort out my priorities from there in order to fully incorporate minimalism into my lifestyle. We’ve always lived a lavish lifestyle and looking back at the years of my life made me realize that I really don’t need the extravagant things and the huge mansion I’m living in right now. It might be a good idea to start with selling our house and looking for some small mobile homes for sale where we can settle for good.I read so many blogs about people who have thrown caution to the wind and set off on their journey of discovery around the world – I absolutely love the idea of doing that!
But when it comes down to it, all I keep thinking is – How did you fund this? How did you survive for 2 years traveling around? Where did you get your food – where did you sleep? I would really like to know the practicalities of living out of a backpack while travelling the world for 2 years! I just can’t picture how to make that work….. Do you have incredibly rich parents who funded this? Did you have an awesomely well paid job that allowed you to save up to then take off? Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to be a wet blanket – I would really like to know, for myself, how this can be done – please!Hey Jillian! Thanks for your question and don’t worry – I completely understand why you’re asking. I actually wrote a really detailed post about how I afford to travel https://www.simplyfiercely.com/how-i-afford-to-travel/ which might answer a lot of your questions. I definitely don’t have rich parents!! The quick answer is over the years I’ve done a mix of working abroad, travelling in very cheap countries (often with a budget around $150/week) – but the post explains in a lot more detail. If you have more questions feel free to comment again and I’ll try and be more specific ?I love the first tip on making it your daily focus and changing the way you word things in your head. It’s so helpful that these pointers can also be applied to all areas in life.– Charmaine
http://charmainenyw.comHey Charmaine, yes, that’s such a good point about how being intentional can be applied to all areas in life – I definitely agree! Thanks so much for stopping by 🙂Hi Jennifer, thank you so much for this post. I found it on pinterest, and since subscribed to your blog. This spoke to me a lot, as well as a few other of your posts I have been reading. We had/have a LOT in common, and I definitely struggle with a spending addiction. While I never got in a literal debt, I would be barely getting by each month living paycheck to paycheck, when I really didn’t need to be if I was just getting what was required. I saw you mentioned the topic of fashion blogs. I know that feeds my spending addiction, but I genuinely enjoy reading a few fashion blogs and I have built a connection with the women who write them. I struggle thinking about letting go of that, do you have any tips on what to do? I am glad I found your blog, and in time maybe I can make a transition to other types of blogs.
Based on my personality, very few people know I have this problem, yet it affects my day every day. After being open about it with my partner, I feel empowered to change my life around, and take control of my life, and create freedom!
Thank you for your inspiring words. <3DanaHi Dana, I’m so sorry! Somehow I missed seeing this comment until now. About fashion blogs, if there are a few that you enjoy reading here are a few things that might help:I’ve recently discovered minimalism by total accident, but it was one of the best things that could have happened. I suffer with anxiety on an on and off basis. At one point when my anxiety seemed it was the highest, we moved from a 1,400 square foot house into one bedroom of my mother in laws how while we built a shop that included 600 square foot of living space. My anxiety was going to be the death of this experience, until I found minimalism.Since then, we have moved into our 600 square foot shop apartment, and I have gotten rid of tons of things I thought I needed. My anxiety has gotten under control quite a bit, but I still have a little ways to go before I am where I want to be with my journey. If I would have known living a more simple lifestyle could change my mental health this much, I would have done it years ago! I’ve also started writing about my journey, and it has helped on so many levels. I still have a ways to go, and I especially realize that after reading this post.I’ve also challenged myself to a 30 Day Minimalist Decluttering Challenge that I created myself. Here’s the link if you would like to check it out. http://www.awelderswife.com/2016/01/30-day-minimalist-decluttering-challenge/Hi Erin! Sorry for my slow reply, but thanks so much for sharing your story! It’s so inspiring to hear about how minimalism helped you with your anxiety. I love your challenge, but I’m currently travelling (and living out of a backpack) so I won’t be able to participate right now. However, I’ll share the details on my social media accounts and spread the word. All theist on your minimalist journey and thank you for commenting!This is such a great post, Jennifer!  I loved the analogy of minimalism and dieting!With our recent move to Seattle, we’ve downsized from a 2200 sq. ft. house (with a garage and shed) to a 980 sq. ft. apartment.  We went through everything we owned prior to moving and got rid of a bunch of stuff using the mantra of “If it’s not beautiful or useful then it doesn’t have value to us.”, but watching how much the movers packed up, I have a feeling that we still have a lot of decluttering left to do when we finally get to move into our apartment in two weeks. 🙂Hi Mackenzie, great to hear from you 🙂  Wow, that is a big move – how exciting!! I love your mantra and it’s so true. I’m sure once you settle in you’ll find a sweet spot that works for your family. Thanks fro you comment and all the best xxThese are all great tips!  I’m a big believer in self care.  If you aren’t doing well, nothing in your life is doing well.  Also, experiences are huge for us, that’s why we became minimalists!Haha, yes – I think that experiences are a huge part of why I became a minimalist too! You’ll have to share your self care tips; I know it’s important but I’m still working to make sure I incorporate it in my life. Thanks for commenting! xI loved this post, Jennifer! The self-care tip really bowled me over, especially the line on not caring about minimalism when you don’t care for yourself. I need to work harder on that.Also, the “Don’t expect to change overnight” tip has a little typo.Will be pinning & tweeting this post! Thanks for sharing with us!Hey Daisy! My hubby felt the same way about the self care tip – I guess he see’s it in me firsthand (and not just about minimalism, about other habits like healthy eating or even just positive thinking.) I’ll be addressing this in my intention plan next month! Thanks for your help with the typo, I need a proofreader at times! And thanks for sharing!! xxI love this guide so much. Thank you for writing it– so many people I know are interested in simple living but just aren’t sure how to start! I’ll be sharing this with them!Aww Daisy, thanks so much for your kind words! I’m glad you found it helpful (and thank you for sharing!) xxComment

No one is actually living, let alone living in a healthy, mindful way. But it’s very important to go beyond just breathing and existing, and live a quality life. Here are some tips for a healthy lifestyle:Tips for a healthy lifestyleLife is a race where you chase time, and responsibilities chase you. But it is essential to have a healthy lifestyle – or at least make some effort towards it. Eat right.We either end up eating a lot of junk, or we enter a starvation mode as we choose a short-cut to a slimming diet. But the key is to know your own body – its weight, its activity level, fat level, etc., and accordingly find out the macronutrients and calories required by your body. If keeping track of your calorie intake and macros and planning a diet seems hard, visit a nutritionist for a simple meal plan. Get moving.Yes, incorporating exercise in your daily routine is a daunting task, especially when you have so much ‘adulting’ to do. But it’s important to keep moving. Try to walk around for five minutes for every hour you sit at work. Try to do stretching exercises whenever you can. You can arrange walking conversations, and take the stairs as often as you can. If your work or your child’s school is far away, walk for at least a part of the journey. Pamper yourself.Amidst all the stress, responsibilities, deadlines, and even depression, we feel too down to take care of ourselves. But it’s important to pamper yourself and take care of yourself. It can be a daily skin routine to put a sheet mask on and sit with your eyes closed for 20 min. It can be a weekly hair spa at home. When you do small things for yourself, you feel important and happy. Make a small list of some minor changes, and make sure to implement them. Have a healthy mind.Find some time for meditation, reading, listening to good music, or doing anything that puts your mind to rest and at the same time instils positivity and peace in your mind. It is said that you should measure what you say to yourself when you are alone. As a result of the tricks of our mind, we often end up being too harsh towards ourselves or encouraging doubts, suspicions, and bitterness. If you’re unable to get rid of negativity, opt for counselling without shame.Be you.The society and this world will always pressurise you to change and conform to accepted norms. Chances are, you have already changed a lot for others. But, to be happy and healthy, don’t forget to be yourself. Otherwise, you will always be under constant tension to hide your reality. Don’t like partying? Skip the Friday night party. Hate makeup? There’s no need to hide the blemishes. Be proud of yourself! Remember that life will always be hard and full of responsibilities. So don’t just sit around and wait for the right time to come for you to start making a change.

It is easy to forget about ourselves and look after our body, so we have come up with a few simple tips that will help you live a healthier lifestyle and get you fitter!Hopefully you can try a few out and see if they work for you. Rome wasn’t built in a day, so don’t except your body to change overnight and remember being fit is always more important than looking fit. Getting a better lifestyle improves your health which in turns will give you more energy and positively affect your attitude. Drinking fluids in general will help you keep healthy. A hydrated body delivers more energy, improved stamina and alertness.  If weight loss is your particular goal, drinking ice water burns extra calories due to the body having to warm up to counter temperature change. Avoid drinking fizzy drinks as much as possible; a lot of people are unaware actually how much sugar is in them, which is subsequently stored by your body if you do not have an active lifestyle.Combining cardio and weight training is a very effective way to keep healthy. Cardio training is the best way to burn fat during activities but effective weight training creates an after burn effect, which means your body burns calories even after you've finished exercising.Finding enough time to work out can be an issue. Interval training is based on higher intensity work for shorter periods of time. This method is far more time friendly and can offer better results than steady workouts done at one particular speed.If you wait for the perfect conditions you’ll never get started, equally you need to enjoy your exercise if it’s going to become a permanent part of your lifestyle. Remember there is no one set path to achieving your goal. Find what works best for and stick with it! The most important thing is getting started, ‘80% of success is showing up’ - Woody AllenFind a workout partner to train with, interaction with people whilst exercising can distract the brain from the activity and help you go for longer.

Being physically inactive, taking too much stress, not sleeping well, smoking and regularly drinking alcohol are some factors which can lead to hormonal imbalance and put one at higher risk of PCOD. The condition causes symptoms like irregular periods or no periods at all, difficulty in getting pregnant because of irregular ovulation, excessive hair growth on face, chest, back or buttocks, weight gain, thinning of hair or hair loss from head, oily skin or acne.PCOS seems to be on the rise ever since lockdown happened, says Dr Aumrita Wadhwa, who is Senior Clinical Practitioner of Homeopathic Medicine. Stress, depression, anxiety and poor sleep quality are a few lifestyle factors that can lead to hormonal imbalance and PCOS.Also read: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): 9 Early Signs And Symptoms You Must Not Ignore; Top Tips For PreventionYour diet, level of physical activity and exercise, sleeping habits and stress levels can also determine severity and risk of PCOS. Maintaining a balance in each of these can help in reducing symptoms and even reversing PCOS.1. DietIt's not about following a fad diet, says Dr Wadhwa. A balanced diet with all foods groups is needed. ""You need to eat healthy and in moderation. Avoid everything that comes in a packet. Processed food is a big no-no. Even when you are craving something tangy or savoury, prepare it at home with natural ingredients, nothing very exotic or fancy"" she tells DoctorNDTV.Consuming a healthy diet can help in reducing symptoms and even reversing PCOSPhoto Credit: iStockAlso read: Weight Loss Tips For Women With PCOS: Follow These For Effective Results2. Avoid use of plastic in all formsFrom water bottles to containers and all cutlery, get rid of all the plastic items from your kitchen. Studies have found that women with PCOS are more vulnerable to exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), which is found in multiple household items. 3. Exercise regularlyRegularity in exercise is the key here, says Dr Wadhwa. You needn't go overboard with it and overdo it. Even half an hour of exercise every day can help you lose weight and be physically and mentally fit. Make sure you do exercise regularly, and include all forms of workouts in your routine, like cardio, weight training and even yoga. Yoga has a calming effect on the mind and is thus recommended for dealing with PCOS effectively.Also read: PCOS Awareness Month: Top 5 Myths About Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Busted!4.

163,https://www.dabur.com/realactiv/tips/7-tips-for-active-lifestyle,"Work has become more competitive than ever before, and our work life is gradually taking over our personal life. It has become increasingly tough to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as we rarely seem to have any time and effort to spare. However, exercise is essential for our physical and mental health, so that we can be productive in our work. To cope with this dilemma, the physical exercise or activity should be carried out in such a way that it does not hamper our work schedule and is very effective at the same time. The good news is that this is possible with a few changes in our lifestyle and habits.
Talking about the habits – you have to ensure that our commute to and from work and our stay at work itself involves physical activity. Most people prefer to drive to work, use lifts instead of stairs, talk to colleagues over the phone instead of walking up to them, etc. After returning home, they usually just sit and relax. During weekends, they may go out and have dinner in a restaurant with friends and family. These are acceptable ways of living your life, but in order to maintain good health, we need to change this pattern. It does not take a lot of time and effort to introduce a little ripple in our routine, as the tips below will show.Consider walking or riding a bicycle to work. If you live far from your workplace, you can take public transport or park your car some distance away and walk the rest of the way. This is a great way to get an early morning workout in addition to helping the environment.Once in your office, take the stairs instead of the lift. If your floor is high up, you can get down a few floors below and then take the stairs. Climbing stairs is an extremely beneficial exercise for your muscles and joints, particularly in your legs and lower body.When communicating with you colleagues in the office, walk over to them whenever you do not need to send an email. This way, you can ensure that you get some exercise by walking inside your office. Apart from providing exercise to your muscles, it will also improve your interpersonal skills.If you have the time, try taking a walk after a meal break at work, or even during a coffee break. If your office has a lawn or a large compound, it can be relaxing as well.If you are into sports, join a sports team in your office.At home, when watching television or reading, consider doing it on a treadmill or an exercise bike.On weekends, go on trips that involve physical activity. Hiking and trekking are good examples. You can also try swimming or the local sports centre. If you have kids, you could visit a paintball arcade. You could even visit a museum and walk around seeing the various exhibits.In addition to these tips, there are plenty of other ways of adopting an active lifestyle. Pick the ones that suit you and interest you the most. It is more important to stay committed to your new routine till it becomes second nature. This can ensure that you stay active and healthy without having to visit the gym.

164,https://www.urdesignmag.com/lifestyle/2020/11/17/11-tips-for-a-healthy-lifestyle/,"There is nothing difficult in taking care of your health. It is enough to follow a few rules to see positive results pretty quickly. Moreover, these rules are simple, logical and their implementation is available to almost everyone. So, what can we do to not only maintain but also improve our health?Proper nutrition does not mean sitting on exhausting diets. You just need to eat more simple and healthy food of your preparation, while reducing the number of processed foods on your table. Also, you need to exclude harmful dishes from the diet (too fatty, too spicy, too sweet, etc.).There is no safe amount of alcohol consumption. It does not matter how much alcohol you drink in a day. Even if it’s a moderate amount, it will still impact your physical and mental health. However, for those who want to have alcohol at their dining table, you should not have more than 10 standard drinks per week.For those people who want to adopt a healthy lifestyle, it is better to quit alcohol. Excessive drinking can lead to some serious health problems such as cancer and liver problems. You need to train yourself daily and fight the temptation of drinking. However, if by quitting alcohol you are facing some severe side-effects you need to take some expert’s help. Some organizations provide a resource for alcohol treatment, so there is no need to worry about finances. You just need to take care of yourself. If you have a friend battling addiction, you can help them by checking them in into your local recovery center. For a normal existence, a person needs to drink at least 1.5-2 liters of water per day. Not liquids in general, but high-quality, clean water. This is necessary to remove toxins from the body and, in general, to maintain balance: acid-base, thermal, hemodynamic, etc. A constant lack of water leads to rapid aging and exacerbation of disease symptoms.Many people are very frightened by the statement that human health can be preserved only by playing sports. Nobody is forcing you to become an athlete. These are just enjoyable activities such as cycling or rollerblading, playing tennis, or light gymnastic warm-up. The main thing is to do this not from time to time, but constantly, at least every other day.Walking is a simple, but at the same time, a unique way to maintain health and youth for a long time. Walking strengthens blood vessels, normalizes blood pressure, trains muscles and joints, and even helps to improve the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. There is only one condition – you need to walk at least 20-30 minutes a day, and the step should not be too long, but energetic.An important point that we often forget is to breathe in the fresh air. Care must be taken to get as much fresh and clean air as possible into your lungs. This means that exercises and jogging should be done away from moving vehicles. You should take a walk where there is more greenery. If you live in a heavily polluted area, be sure to get out at least once or twice a week to nature: to the forest or the shore of a sea.The condition of your home and office directly affects your mood and well-being. Be sure to organize the space around you in the best possible way. Take care of the cleanliness and hygiene of the premises, surround yourself with objects pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically equip your workplace. You should also pay attention to the materials from which the things you use are created, giving preference to high-quality, natural, and environmentally friendly. Do you think the daily routine is for children? Not at all! Going to bed early and getting up early at the same time daily, you will feel much more cheerful and energetic than if you have no schedule at all. It is also necessary to take into account the natural biorhythms of a person and their relationship with the daily cycle. It has long been proven that sleep before midnight gives the body much more rest than even the latest awakening.Easy to say yet difficult to do! Try not to drive yourself to exhaustion by working hard. Avoid getting involved in conflicts and aggressive arguments. Don’t savor bad news and crime. Do not watch films that are unpleasant to you, even for the company. In general, try not to do what worsens your mood, because the state of our nervous system and internal organs is inextricably linked with the mood.Is it worth reminding how much our beauty and health suffer from addictions? Smoking causes problems with the skin, teeth, throat, blood vessels, lungs, and stomach. Frequent alcohol consumption destroys the nervous system and increases appetite, forcing a person to “eat” too much, gaining excess weight. Over time, computer games are highly addictive, dull, and lead to visual impairment and poor posture. So is it worth risking the most valuable thing – your health – for the sake of dubious pleasure?A simple yet highly effective way to promote health is to look like a healthy and successful person. The advice of doctors will not help you with this. Only self-confidence and control of your appearance will bring good results. You will see changes very quickly if you follow these conditions every day:A few things are just outside your ability to control. Try not to feel debilitated over being sick. Try not to stress over inclination on edge. And try not to get discouraged over your downturn. Utilize the tools you need to accomplish the best wellbeing you can. And afterward, enjoy your life. comments Guideshealthtips",7.215,10,5.49,9.56,3.81,932

While sunscreen is a skin-saver and a good moisturiser can work wonders, some of the best anti-aging tips have less to do with creams and lotions and more to do with healthy lifestyle habits. Here’s a look at six ways to feel younger in body and mind. The secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age. – Lucille Ball1. Get a handle on stressChronic stress doesn’t just make us feel tired and irritable – research shows that it can actually cause the cells in our bodies to age faster. If you feel frazzled on a regular basis, it’s time to take action: Do some breathing or mindfulness exercises, meditate, sign up for a weekly yoga class, spend time with friends or take up a relaxing hobby. 2. Make exercise a habit It’s true – regular exercise can keep you young. Medical News Today cites a recent study “involving people over 70 who have exercised for years” which found that “participants’ hearts, lungs, and muscles were in equivalent shape to those of people in their 40s.” So, aim to do about 30 minutes of exercise each day – walking, swimming, and water aerobics are all excellent options. Just remember to check with your GP before starting any new activity.In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks. – John Muir3. Enjoy the great outdoors Being outdoors is good for you. In fact, a 2019 study found that “Taking at least twenty minutes out of your day to stroll or sit in a place that makes you feel in contact with nature will significantly lower your stress hormone levels.” Whether you take the dog for a walk, have a picnic in the park or head to the beach, make sure that you spend some time outdoors enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.4. Eat well Keep your energy levels up by eating a healthy diet that includes good quality proteins, healthy fats, and a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. Also remember to drink enough water throughout the day and try to avoid sugar-rich and processed foods.We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing. – George Bernard Shaw5. Have some funHaving fun is a great stress reliever, so remember to take time to do the things you really enjoy, whether that’s watching a good comedy, spending time with your grandkids or playing card games. Of course, one of the best ways to have fun is to spend time with friends who make you feel energised and alive – these social interactions have a positive impact on emotional and physical wellbeing. 6. Get enough sleep Sleep deprivation has been linked to a host of health problems, and it may even make you age faster – ScienceDaily cites a 2015 study which suggests that “one night of partial sleep deprivation promotes biological aging in older adults.” So, try to get about seven to eight hours of sleep per night. If you have trouble dozing off, try these tips: go to bed at the same time each night, avoid caffeine from the late afternoon onwards, and read a book or have a shower before bed to relax. © Copyright 2017 Evergreen Lifestyle Villages.

167,https://mint.intuit.com/blog/minimalist-lifestyle/minimalist-lifestyle-tips/,"Mint has you covered during coronavirus. Stay up-to-date with the latest financial guidelines and resources here.Minimalism has become a popular practice in recent years. When you live as a minimalist, you strive to only use things that serve a purpose. It’s about living simply and having only what you need to go about your daily life. For instance, some people may start a no-spend challenge or only fill their home with items they absolutely need. Not only could you save money, but you can also save time on cleaning and organizing.Practicing minimalism is an ongoing process. You’ll always find ways to improve and modify your minimalism. To start, evaluate what currently serves a purpose in your life and what may be superfluous. When you practice a minimalist mindset, you’re choosing to live a more focused life. You may start with cleaning up your budget and then move on to organizing your home. Taking the first steps to declutter your life is a big move, but you might need a game plan to make these habits stick.Many of us may have too much stuff, and may even be spending too much on unnecessary purchases. Establishing a consistent and healthy budget should help you cut down on the things you don’t need and may even reduce your anxiety and stress. To keep track of your minimalist budget, download our app for easy accessibility. If you’re considering doing some decluttering this season, skip to our infographic or keep reading for in-depth tips on practicing a minimalist lifestyle.When first starting out your journey, it’s important to start small. From changing your shopping habits to going strictly digital, there are lots of ways to switch up your routine. Here are our go-to tips for kickstarting your minimalism journey.Minimalism doesn’t mean you never go shopping, it just means you’re more intentional with your purchases. Whether you’re in need of a new pair of running shoes or work pants, invest in quality pieces that will last you a long time. Even though a higher price tag may be less than ideal at the time, you’ll likely save money in the long run by cutting down on frequent purchases. Not to mention, you’ll cut down on waste — one garbage truck of clothes is discarded every second.If you’re a big reader or movie watcher, consider going digital with your collection. This will save space in your home and make sure you can always find what you want. Instead of having to go to the store for your next read, you could get it at your fingertips in a couple of clicks. If you like to physically feel the book pages every time you flip the page, consider checking out your local library. You can find all sorts of books at no charge.One of the most important parts of minimalism is cutting down on things you don’t need. To start decluttering, identify what serves a purpose in your life and what doesn’t. From there, start to see how you can cut down items that don’t add value to your life, and then get rid of them entirely. You could test the waters by doing a mindful money challenge before decluttering your whole life.As you start to declutter your home, consider what products could be reused. One simple change could be swapping out your disposable water bottles for a glass reusable one. Or, even bring your reusable takeaway coffee cup with you every time you visit your local cafe. Not only could you get a discount for bringing your own cup, but you’re also helping cut down on single-use products!Once you get into a rhythm, give every item a place. Get creative with storage bins and organizers to ensure you’re able to store exactly what you need. If you don’t have a spot for some of your extras, it may be time to consider if they are items you really need to keep. As your minimalist space falls into place, hold yourself accountable for putting away items once you’re done using them.It’s one thing to start out your minimalism journey, but another to keep your practice going. To live an intentional life, there are some easy practices to follow. Keep reading to see where this could help save you more time, money, and stress.A popular practice in minimalism is prioritizing experiences over buying material items. Some people value the memories created from trips or classes over having the latest gadgets or fashions. Determine where you stand and spend intentionally.As minimalism may cut down on your “extra” budget expense, you may also have more leeway to spend on other things. With this extra budget, be intentional with where you choose to put your money. Save up your takeaway coffee budget to invest in a weekend away with your family. You may find yourself saving more and spending less time on things that drain your budget.Take time to assess your current spending habits and then consistently review them. Always cut out things that take up space or events that drain your energy. As you get more comfortable, you may find yourself wanting to get rid of things you thought you couldn’t live without. For instance, your cluttered kitchen may be useless if you reach for the same items every time you cook — cut down on the things you haven’t used to make more room to cook.Turns out, the average American spends $18,000 a year on unnecessary purchases. As you review your budget, you may be able to cut out a large portion of these expenses. For things you may not want to completely eliminate, find inexpensive alternatives. You may swap a vacation across the county for a staycation in the comfort of your backyard.Letting go of things you can’t control may seem easier said than done. To find that balance, start by focusing on things you love to do or have. Once you have narrowed down what’s most important to you, focus your energy on that. Being thankful for what you do have may even cut down on your budget. You may find yourself reusing what you do have rather than wanting more.Practice gratitude and focus on the positives. Instead of scrolling through social media, write out three to five things you’re grateful for. Practicing gratitude first thing in the morning may put you in a positive mood and help you prepare for the day ahead of you. Being grateful for what you have might even cut your urge to overspend on things you don’t need.

Living like a minimalist may take some time to get used to, but the payoff can be worth it. When decluttering your life, you may find yourself less stressed over little things. You may even discover your budget is easier to maintain and gain more clarity when making decisions. Minimalism may shed light on what you do and don’t want to focus your time and energy on. Many areas of life may feel the effects of minimalism, like your budget, home, and your relationships.Do you think you could be a minimalist? If so, check out our top TED Talk tips for practicing minimalism and how it may benefit you.

171,https://www.thehealthylifefoundation.org/category/lifestyle-tips/,"We often hear about nutrients but do we actually know what they are?Nutrients are the essential compounds that the body needs in order to stay healthy. Nutrients must come from food and they’re vital for helping our body repair and grow, providing us with energy and also preventing disease. Nutrients are broken down into 2 categories- Macronutrients & Micronutrients.  Macronutrients are the essential building blocks of our diet and are consumed in large amounts. These include protein, carbohydrates and fat, which provide your body with energy. Micronutirients come from vitamins and minerals and are consumed in small doses. However, their impact on the body’s health is critical, and deficiency in any of them can cause severe and even life-threatening conditions.There are six main groups of essential micronutrients and macronutrients.1.) Protein–Your body needs protein to help fuel energy and carry oxygen throughout your body. It is essential for keeping the muscles, bones, hormones and tissue in your body healthy and functioning properly.  2.) Carbohydrates – Good complex whole carbohydrates fuel your body with energy. They are also high in fibre, metabolism boosting and can help you feel fuller longer.3.) Fats– Healthy fats help to aid hormone function, protect your heart, your memory and the absorption of specific nutrients. 4.) Vitamins– Our bodies rely on vitamins to function properly, ward of disease and to stay healthy. There are 13 essential vitamins that the body needs to function properly, including vitamins A, C, B6, and D. 5.) Minerals – Minerals are crucial for many body functions, including building strong bones and teeth, regulating your metabolism and staying properly hydrated. Some of the most common minerals are calcium, iron, and zinc.6.) Water –Water is crucial for the functionality of every system in your body including your heart, brain and kidneys. It also helps flush out toxins, carry nutrients to cells and hydrate your body.The best way to ensure you are getting all the nutrients that your body needs, is through a varied diet with plenty of fruits & vegetables, healthy proteins, fats and whole grains. Millions of people around the world are experiencing high levels of stress during these very challenging times.  For some of us, it can be debilitating and often damaging to our health.  Stress is a significant factor in mental health problems including anxiety and depression.

They include brightly coloured fruits & vegetables, fortified & fibre rich grains, & lean meats, beans, & nuts. Reduce Added Sugars – Many people consume more sugar than they realize. It’s important to be aware of your sugar intake because added sugars contribute zero nutrients & added calories. Too much sugar can also lead to extra pounds &contribute to chronic illness.March is Ovarian Cancer Awareness month.  Every year, 295,000 women around the world are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and only half will survive beyond five years. Ovarian cancer has four main symptoms:These can also be symptoms of other, less serious, conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome so if you’re experiencing them it doesn’t necessarily mean you have ovarian cancer. If your symptoms are:You should make an appointment with your GP as soon as possible.

This is a day that unites people, communities and entire countries to raise awareness and take action. To find out more visit www.worldcancerday.orgCancer is a disease which occurs when changes in a group of normal cells within the body lead to uncontrolled, abnormal growth forming a lump called a tumour; this is true of all cancers except leukaemia (cancer of the blood). If left untreated, tumours can grow and spread into the surrounding normal tissue, or to other parts of the body via the bloodstream and lymphatic systems, and can affect the digestive, nervous and circulatory systems or release hormones that may affect body function.Key Cancer FactsCancers can be caused by a number of different factors and, as with many other illnesses, most cancers are the result of exposure to a number of different causal factors. It is important to remember that not all cancers can be prevented. However, around 1/3 of cancer cases can be prevented by reducing behavioural & dietary risks.   Alcohol – The evidence that all types of alcoholic drinks are a cause of a number of cancers is now stronger than ever before. Evidence suggests that , the more alcohol drinks people consume, the higher the risk of many cancers. Being overweight – Excess weight has been linked to an increased risk of developing 12 different cancers, including bowl & pancreatic cancers. In general, greater weight gain, particularly as adults, is associated with greater cancer risks. Diet and nutrition – Experts suggest that diets and nutritional intake, particularly diets high in red meats, processed meats, salted foods and low in fruits and vegetables have an impact on cancer risks, particularly colorectum, nasopharynx and stomach.Physical activity – Regular physical activity not only helps to reduce excess body fat and the cancer risks associated with this, but being physically active can help to reduce the risks of developing colon, breast and endometrial cancers.Tobacco – Tobacco smoke contains at least 80 different cancer-causing substances (carcinogenic agents). When smoke is inhaled the chemicals enter the lungs, pass into the blood stream and are transported throughout the body.Lonising Radiation – Manmade sources of radiation can cause cancer and are a risk for workers. These include radon, x-rays, gamma rays and other forms of high-energy radiation. Prolonged and unprotected exposure to ultraviolet radiations from the sun, sunlamps & tanning beds can also lead to melanoma & skin malignancies. Early Detection Testing-  Early Screening Tests means testing for early signs of cancer before people have any symptoms. If cancer is detected at an early stage, before symptoms even appear, it is easier to treat and there is a better chance of survival.Its National Love Your Liver Awareness Month! Our liver is an absolute powerhouse of an organ and is responsible for over 500 functions of the body. Amongst its many important roles, the liver filters, cleanses and breakdowns everything that passes through our body. Quite simply, it is our body’s natural detoxifier. When the liver becomes overwhelmed with toxins, its natural working cycle slows down. This happens when our body becomes overloaded with things such as alcohol, drugs, processed and fatty foods and chemicals (such as pesticides left on produce). The good news is, there are lifestyle habits you can make that will keep your liver healthy and help stimulate its natural ability to expel toxins from the body.      Here are 3 simple steps to improve your liver health:Here are 8 powerful foods to eat to keep your liver healthy:1. Citrus Fruits: Fruits like grapefruit, oranges & lemons all boost the liver’s cleansing ability as citrus fruits help the liver to produce the detoxifying enzymes that flush out pollutants.2. Cruciferous Vegetables: Such asbroccoli, cauliflower, kale & cabbage as they contain glucosinolate, which helps the liver to produce detoxifying enzymes. They also contain sulfur compounds that aid with liver health. Leafy vegetables are high in chlorophyll, which leaches toxins out of the blood stream.  3. Beetroot: Beets assist with increasing oxygen by cleansing the blood, & can break down toxic wastes to help them be excreted quicker. They stimulate bile flow and boost enzymatic activity. Beets also contain fiber & Vitamin C, which both are natural cleansers for the digestive system. 4. Turmeric: The compounds in Turmeric have been found to improve liver function  & reduce the levels of toxicity in the body by stimulating the lymphatic system & removing toxins efficiently.  5.Walnuts: Walnuts are high in the amino acid arginine & assist the liver in detoxifying ammonia. They’re also rich in glutathione & omega-3 fatty acids, which aid the natural liver cleansing functions.6.Garlic: Garlic is packed with sulphur, which activates liver enzymes that help your body flush out toxins. It also is rich in selenium, whichis an essential micronutrient that has been shown to help boost the natural antioxidant enzyme levels in our liver. 7. Avocado: Avocado’s are rich in glutathione, which is a substance that is present throughout the body. It’s function is to protect cells against oxidation & to help the liver rid itself of toxins.  8. Apples: Apples have high levels of pectin, which helps the body facilitate the process of cleansing and releasing toxins from the liver. Apple juice (organic) is also recommended for liver detoxification 9. Green Tea: Green Tea is rich in catechins, which is a powerful antioxidant known to improve liver function. Good nutrition is an essential part of both mental and physical health. According to the World Health Organization, better nutrition is related to improved health at all ages, a lower risk of diseases, and longevity. Having good nutrition comes from eating a wide variety of foods and drinks to ensure your body gets enough vitamins, minerals and essential nutrients that it needs to function at its best. If you feel confused by all the conflicting diet and nutrition advice out there, you’re not alone. But having good nutrition doesn’t have to be overly complicated. By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how incorporate good eating habits to ensure optimum health not only for your mind but for your body as well.  As the festive season comes to an end & everyone has drank probably more champagne than they would like to admit, more and more people seem to be jumping on the “Dry January Train” where you avoid drinking any booze for the entire month. Some do it as a way to detox from the excessive drinking over the holidays while others make it part of a New Year’s resolution to drink less.  Either way, giving up booze or limiting the amount you drink can have amazing health benefits on your mind and body.  This is because alcohol puts metabolic stress on the liver, raises blood pressure and can also weaken your immune system among many other health problems. (most dependant on how much you drink).Here are some of the health benefits of having a Dry January:1.) Better Sleep – Alcohol disrupts the quality of sleep as it decreases “Restorative REM Sleep” reducing the amount of time spent in a deep sleep.2.) Your waistline may shrink – Boozy beverages are high in calories. So having a few drinks a day can increase your calorific intake which often makes you put on excess weight.  Alcohol also wreaks havoc on your blood sugar levels causing your body to crave salty, greasy, sugary and starchy foods.3.) Improved Concentration and Mood – Alcohol has many different effects on your mental health. It can increase your risk of anxiety and depression because it depletes your brains serotonin levels. It also depresses the central nervous system which can make your mood fluctuate.4.) Better Skin – Alcohol is extremely dehydrating and can leave your skin looking dry and sallow. It can also deplete vitamins and minerals that are essential for healthy skin.5.) May change your attitude towards alcohol – Studies have shown that 64% of people who participated in Dry January drank less alcohol even 6 months after they finished.The important thing is to continue healthy drinking habits beyond January. Studies have shown for optimum health, people should be drinking within the recommended low risk alcohol guidelines across the whole year which means that men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units per week on a regular basis.Christmas is all about enjoying yourself which often means over indulging in alcohol, food and unhealthy treats which usually leaves us feeling bloated and sluggish. If you want to feel completely refreshed and energised for the New Year, a post Christmas detox can often do the trick. A detox has the ability to stimulate the liver and kidneys to drive toxins out of the body, and rejuvenate our organs, thus helping our body and mind feel completely re-energised.Here are 5 quick and easy ways to give your body a total cleanse for the New Year:1.) Drink plenty of Water (preferably with lemon) – Water helps your body function properly and is also essential for removing waste and toxins from the body. This makes it incredibly important to stay hydrated. You can also infuse your water with lemon and ginger which are great for aiding the cleansing process.2.) Exercise – Exercise helps with the body’s detoxification process as it stimulates your digestive track and  lymphatic system which eliminates waste. Every time we exercise, we take in more oxygen which is essential to helping our cells to function which also helps our cells remove toxins.3.) Eat Detoxing Super Foods and fuel your body with the Good Stuff – Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, healthy whole grains and beans. These are loaded with fibre which is essential for healthy bowel movements. Eat veg such as broccoli, kale and spinach as they are super beneficial for the liver and enhance detoxification in your system. Fruits and vegetables are also loaded with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that keep the body healthy and boost the immune system.4.) Drink Matcha Green Tea – Matcha Green Tea contains high levels of catechin polyphenols that help stop damaging toxins from recirculating in your body. They also help encourage the body to make glutathione which is a liver antioxidant.5.) Sleep allows your brain to reorganize and recharge itself as well as remove toxic waste that has accumulated throughout the day. Sleep deprivation prohibits your body from performing necessary functions so toxins can build up and affect several aspects of health. Aim for 7 – 9 hour of sleep per night.The mission of The Healthy Life Foundation is to support scientific and medical research targeted at preventing degenerative disease and extending both human health span and life span and thus improving quality of life nationally and globally.© The Healthy Life Foundation 2018Free Charity Hosting by Kualo",6.82,9.31,4.38,9.34,4.25,3108

The phrase 'healthy lifestyle' is an abbreviated definition of how you should live if you want to live a vibrant, active life with a healthy body and healthy mind. Creating a healthy lifestyle doesn't have to mean drastic changes. Making gradual small changes to your diet and activity habit can have a big impact.

You know the obvious behaviors that describe someone who is healthy and takes care of themselves. A healthy person doesn't smoke, tries to maintain a healthy weight, eats healthy foods with plenty of fruits, vegetables and fiber and, of course, exercises on a regular basis.

Then there are other elements to add to the list. A healthy person also knows how to manage stress, gets good quality sleep each night, doesn't drink too much, doesn't sit too much—basically, does everything in moderation all the time. When you look at everything that could possibly go into a healthy lifestyle, you can see just how hard all of those things are in our current world.

The good news is, you don't have to change everything at the same time. In fact, the trick to healthy living is making small changes—taking more steps each day,﻿﻿ adding fruit to your cereal, having an extra glass of water, or saying no to that second helping of buttery mashed potatoes. One thing you can do right now to make your lifestyle healthier is to move more.

You know you need to exercise, but there are many excuses not to do it. You're too busy, don't know where to start, you're not motivated or you're afraid you'll injure yourself. Maybe you think exercise has to be really hard or it isn't good enough.
It's great if you can spend time exercising—meaning you're sweating, working in your target heart rate zone, or doing something to strengthen your body. But it doesn't always have to be that way. Moderate activities like chores, gardening and walking can make a difference.﻿﻿
Whatever definition you have about what exercise is or isn't, the bottom line is that exercise is movement. Whether it's walking around the block or running a marathon, that movement is exercise and every time you move more than you normally do, it counts.

Even if you opt for small changes, the benefits are still pretty amazing. For example, increasing your activity level can help you to reach and maintain a healthy weight. If you are currently overweight, small steps toward that goal can have an impact.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that if you are overweight, reduction of 5 to 10% of your total body weight can help lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar.
In fact, you don't even have to have a goal to lose weight, especially if you have trouble sticking to a program. Why not focus on being healthy to start and worry about the weight loss once you've got some healthy habits under your belt?

The great thing about moving is that just a few minutes a day can have other lasting benefits, many of which you may not even be aware of. Just some of the benefits include:﻿﻿

You can start the process of being healthy and now by adding a little more activity to your life. If you're not ready for a structured program, start small. Every little bit counts and it all adds up to burning more calories.﻿﻿

Schedule time when you turn off the TV and computer. Once a week, turn off all screens and do something a little more physical with your family. Play games, take a walk, do almost anything that will be more active than sitting on the couch.

Look for small ways to walk more. When you get the mail, take a walk around the block, take the dog for an extra outing each day, or walk on your treadmill for five minutes before getting ready for work. When you're on the phone, pace around or even do some cleaning while gabbing. This is a great way to stay moving while doing something you enjoy.

Get housework done and increase daily movement at the same time. Shoveling snow, working in the garden, raking leaves, sweeping the floor—these kinds of activities may not be vigorous exercise, but they can keep you moving while getting your house in order.

Make a list of all the physical activities you do on a typical day. If you find that the bulk of your time is spent sitting, make another list of all the ways you could move more—getting up each hour to stretch or walk, walk the stairs at work, etc.

Eating a healthy diet is another part of a healthy lifestyle. Not only can a nutritious diet help with weight management, but it can also improve your health and quality of life as you get older.﻿﻿

You already know about the food groups and the fact that it is recommended that you eat more fruits and vegetables and fewer processed foods. You probably have a list of things you know you should do for a healthier diet but, again, making too many changes at once can backfire. Going on a restrictive diet may make you crave the very foods you're trying to avoid.​

Another approach is to look for ways to make smaller changes each day.﻿﻿ Just a few ideas for changing how you eat include:

Creating a healthy lifestyle doesn't have to mean drastic changes. You may adapt to change better when it doesn't require you to overhaul your entire life. Just pick one thing and work on that one thing every day, letting the rest of your life and habits stay the same. You may be surprised that those small changes really can make a difference.

You can help reduce your risk of heart disease by working on living a healthy life, strengthening your body, and giving it the nutrition it needs. Even seemingly small changes in your lifestyle can have a positive impact on your heart health. At Indus Healthcare, with offices located in Pomona, West Covina, and Montclair, California, Dr. Amit Paliwal performs annual physicals during which he can let you know if your heart health is at risk. If so, he can formulate a plan to help you take care of your heart.Some of the most common risk factors for poor heart health are things you can make changes to by simply altering your lifestyle. They include:Ready to start living a heart-healthy life? Start with these nine tips:A heart-healthy diet starts with cutting down on red meat. Limit beef and pork, and consider meatless meals a few days a week to keep yourself healthier overall.Choose chicken and turkey in small portions, and try looking for protein in dairy or legumes to help substitute for meat. Processed fats like shortening and margarine can be bad for your health, and you should use even more natural fats like lard and butter only in moderation.Cook with olive and grapeseed oil, or canola oil in a pinch. Add healthy fat to your diet in the form of fatty fish, yummy nuts, or wholesome avocado.Lack of exercise is bad for you and can lead to obesity. Plan on getting even just 15 minutes a day for a walk, or do some other low-impact aerobic activity. According to the CDC, if you smoke, you are 70% more likely to develop heart disease than a non-smoker. Find a program or method that works for you, and make the commitment to quit for the sake of your heart.More than three drinks a day is a sign of a problem, and even more than one drink a day can harm your heart health. Make that bottle of wine last a few days, and save the champagne for special occasions. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, often shows up as an early prelude to a heart attack. Start taking your BP with a home cuff or at the pharmacy whenever you can, and keep a log so you can learn where your baseline is and what makes your numbers go up or down.We know, it’s easier said than done. But decreasing stress in your life is good for the whole you, not just your heart health.

Advice from Nest and AssistantNest Thermostat owners have saved over 50 billion kilowatt hours of energy since we first introduced the device, which comes to $3 billion in energy bill savings. In honor of Earth Day, the Google Assistant can help you save even more. Just say “Hey Google, give me an Earth Day tip” for simple ways you can save energy, like changing the temperature on your Nest Thermostat by just a few degrees until the leaf symbol pops up, so you know you’re saving energy.Get the buzz on bees from today’s DoodleSee what all the buzz is about in today’s interactive Earth Day Doodle, made in collaboration with The Honeybee Conservancy. Guide your bee to pollinate flowers while learning fun facts about bees and how they help the planet. Even while social distancing, there are several things you can do to help, like supporting your local beekeeper, planting a pollinator garden or creating a bee bath.A little “how to” help Recently, we’ve seen a spike in “how to” sustainability queries related to food, recycling and composting. If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you can ask your Google Assistant how to recycle specific items and you’ll get local city and town specific answers. You can also check out our curated YouTube Earth Day playlist where you can learn how to compost, fix old clothing or turn those leftovers into a new meal. “How to freeze” has been a particular popular question. Here are a few of the answers I found particularly helpful:How to freeze milk? Place the milk in your freezer in its original plastic container or glass freezer-safe container. Make sure to leave room to allow the milk to expand, so remove some milk if needed. When you're ready to use the frozen milk, allow it to thaw in the fridge.How to freeze eggs? To freeze whole eggs, you simply mix the eggs together and pour the mixture into either an ice cube tray, or a freezer-safe container or bag. If you will need to use individual eggs, it would make more sense to make sure each ice cube tray holds only one egg so that you can easily separate them.How to freeze broccoli? Broccoli—florets and stems—must be blanched for effective freezing. If you freeze it raw, you'll wind up with bitter, drab green, shriveled stems. Blanching or steaming preserves the bright green color and tasty flavor. You can either blanch in boiling water for three minutes or steam for five minutes.Enjoying planet Earth from wherever you are With travel plans paused, national parks temporarily closed and a collective effort to stay socially distant, the world feels a bit out of reach right now. While there’s no substitute for the real thing, virtual vacations are a great way to experience our planet from wherever you are sheltering in place using Google Earth. If you’re seeking natural beauty, explore the most enchanting forests, striking waterfalls, or unusual lakes around the globe. For those interested in the other creatures that share our planet, learn about the kākāpō, sea turtles or humpback whales. For anyone interested in a more scientific journey, learn about the ecosystems of the world, understand the impact of keystone species on their habitats, or learn how to be a scientist in your backyard—all you need is your smartphone.I hope these tips are an easy way to get started. At Google, we know that individual actions collectively can make a big difference, and we’re happy to support everyone on their journey to a more sustainable life. Let’s stay in touch.

+91 80801 77000A healthy urban lifestyle calls for that one indispensable main: a fully-functional immune system backed with regular detoxification.When talking about detox, the in-fashion buzzword is Wheatgrass Juice – the latest ingredient to have found a seemingly permanent spot in the World of Natural Healthcare. The benefits of this magic herb rediscovered, and how!The origin of this herb dates back to more than 5000 years ago (yes, it’s anything but a latest discovery). We owe it all to the Egyptians who chanced upon the young wheat shoots, found it sacred and readily consumed them, learning about its health benefits in the process. Wheatgrass has been in use for thousands of years, as an integral part of Ayurveda.Prepared from the freshly-sprouted leaves of Triticum Aestivum (the common wheat plant), Wheatgrass Juice comes with a horde of benefits. From improving immune functions, to boosting gut health and detoxifying the liver – this herb is a one-stop wonder. It is house to Vitamins A, C and E, as well as iron, magnesium, calcium and amino acids.Like any other green plant, Wheatgrass packs in the punch of the pigment chlorophyll. Being the first product of sunlight, chlorophyll contains more light energy than any other food element. Science is testimony to the fact that chlorophyll arrests growth of bacteria.Wheatgrass Juice wins the race of chlorophyll content – hands-down – owing to its unique harvest technique. Instead of the regular 12-15 day timeline, Kapiva harvests its Wheatgrass 8 days after irrigation, when the chlorophyll content is maximum.Studies show that regular consumption of the same resulted in the decrease in cholesterol level.To lead a healthy life in an urban setting, a proper-functioning gut is equally important. Keep your daily probiotics handy at all times. Probiotics are “good” bacteria touted to help maintain digestive health and boost the immune system. They can be found in abundance in Yogurt.Kapiva Probiotics Gummies is one such probiotics which you can carry – #OnTheGo – and consume whenever you want. These candy-like, yummy gummies not only promote gut health and help boost immunity, but also keep you enriched with essential nutrients.Kapiva Probiotic Gummies are healthy, probiotic supplements, further infused with the goodness of Amla. It comes in a yummy Orange flavour with a dash of Curcumin (Turmeric) imparting a vibrant yellow colour to it. Packed with essential vitamins and minerals, these easy-to-use supplements are Gelatin-free too! The perfect health supplement for all the urban health and wellness seekers.

In fact, many young people truly believe that good health is a key to success, and 9 of every 10 millennials try to live healthy lifestyles in order to be successful in other aspects of their lives. Check out these 5 tips to start maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle, no matter your age.Falling into a trap of eating while you’re bored is all too common. Similarly, if you’re ever out on a long road trip, it’s too easy to stop at a gasoline station and buy a bag of chips if you’re hungry. Instead of buying junk food, opt instead for preparing healthy snack beforehand, think of snacks like these:Drinking water can prevent a plethora of diseases and is a crucial part of a healthy diet. However, the vast majority of people don’t give it the importance it deserves in our day to day lives. A few benefits of regularly drinking water include preventing headaches, preventing cancer, weight loss, and is even a mood booster.Similarly, the devastating effects of not drinking water are serious and can include digestive problems, stomach ulcers, joint pain, and premature aging. The Institute of Medicine typically recommends that women have 9 cups of water a day, while men drink 13 cups a day, in order to have a healthier lifestyle.Your body’s posture is imperative because it affects the way you walk, run, and move around in general. Having a healthy lifestyle requires moving with a healthy posture in order to not put too much strain on one area of our bodies. Forming a habit of walking with good posture doesn’t only improve circulation and digestion, but betters the structure of your spine, especially to those who work sitting down all day.Additionally, walking and communicating with a healthy posture displays a personal image of self-confidence and authority to those around you. That’s why, making this a habit can lead you to have greater self-confidence, and even change the way you interact in social situations.With everyone’s daily obligations, religiously setting time aside every week to go sweat at the gym doesn’t sound too enticing. But, planning activities that interest you and that provide some fitness value is a good way to start. A few enjoyable activity ideas include going and taking a Zumba class, or practicing yoga. Note that, for starters, the most important priority is to establish a routine, almost as automatic as brushing your teeth. Then after making this a habit, optimizing your workout for better results will become easier.Almost 60% of Americans enjoy drinking coffee, and for many, caffeine is a daily necessity. Without their morning cup of coffee, many claim to be in a bad mood, or not being able to concentrate at work. To make the most out of your cup of coffee and maintain a healthy lifestyle, try to opt for black coffee, or minimize how much creamer and sugar you put in your coffee, to prevent from suffering the effects of high blood sugar levels.Similarly, drinking coffee with slight moderation can contribute to a healthier life since it is the greatest source of antioxidants in the American diet. Antioxidants provide a defense to the body’s cells against harmful molecules.Creating routines and habits similar to the ones stated above not only contribute to a healthier life, but can also lead to lower health insurance premiums for you. Logically, dedicating yourself to living an active and healthier life, can lower your premiums because in your insurance company’s eyes, the risk of you becoming ill is minimized.Make sure to have a great team of agents by your side.

A healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet. This does not mean cutting out important food groups of your diet or limiting yourself on the amount of calories per day. A well-rounded diet involves eating most food groups in every meal. Meats, dairy, fruits and vegetables are all important components of a meal that will ensure your body is healthy.

180,https://grownandflown.com/tips-healthy-eating-fitness-habits-college-students/,"Grown and FlownParentingby Grown and Flown | January 7, 2016College can wreak havoc on a student’s body. Between all-you-can-eat dining hall buffets, unhealthy but oh-so-tempting food options on campus, irregular schedules and sleep patterns, increased alcohol consumption, decreased physical activity, stress, and limited finances, it can be all too easy for college students to inadvertently develop unhealthy eating habits and pack on the pounds.A healthy diet and lifestyle play a big role in mental and physical well-being, including increasing energy, improving mood and cognitive function, and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight during college.College kids are often on the go and consumed by hectic schedules, which can lead to skipping or missing a meal. Even if you’re just chained to a desk in the library, the body needs fuel (food) to function. For many college students, it’s not that they’re eating unhealthy foods, but rather they’re letting long periods of time go by between eating occasions.Skipping meals does not promote weight loss; in fact, it slows your metabolism, leads to poor food choices later, and can lead to overeating and weight gain. Eating every 3 to 5 hours helps keep your brain functioning optimally and your mood positive.Oatmeal is great to keep in your dorm room for an easy, quick, filling breakfast (or overnight oats if you have a fridge and are less than halfway functioning in the mornings). Try using the unflavored variety to cut the sugar and spice it up with cinnamon, berries or other fruit, and add a small handful of unsalted nuts or a tablespoon of nut butter for some protein. Oatmeal can also be a good on-the-go meal for between classes if you know you won’t have time to hit the dining hall, as you can often ask in a coffee shop for hot water and a to-go cup to make and eat your oatmeal on the go.Students often snack their way through the day and night, but it’s often foods laden with calories, fat, and sodium. When snacking is done right, it can curb appetite and help maintain a healthy weight.Keep healthy, portable, easy to grab food items in your dorm room or apartment and toss a few in your bag when you head to class or the library. Include a mix of protein and fiber to keep you fueled and full.Good snack options include (but are not limited to):Popcorn is a great whole grain, high fiber, low-calorie nosh and healthier, satisfying alternative to chips (as long as it’s not the butter or kettle corn version!). Buy the plain or lightly salted variety and spice it up on your own if you want to (I like to do smoked paprika, chili powder, cinnamon, or a little parmesan cheese depending on my mood). When you’re starving or in a rush (or stuck in the library!), having healthy snacks on stashed in your backpack can help you resist the temptation of the junk food snacks that are often readily available on campus.Time is a valuable commodity for college students and exercise is often the first thing to fall off the daily to do list. Exercise helps you sleep better at night, improves mood, decreases stress, improves focus for better studying, and makes it easier to achieve or maintain a healthy weight.Aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. Consider joining an intramural sport or taking a fitness or dance class as a course (you’ll get exercise in and earn credit for it!). Simple things like catching up with a friend over a walk around campus, walking or biking to and from class, parking your car further away from campus, and picking a seat on a higher floor in the library and taking the stairs add up and burn calories, too.Substitute water for energy drinks and soft drinks. Water is needed by all cells and organs in the body in order to function properly, but college students often reach for energy drinks and other flavored beverages throughout the day and night instead. These drinks are packed with calories and sugar and cause blood sugar to spike and then crash, disrupting energy levels, increasing hunger, and causing weight gain all too easily.Stick to coffee or tea if you’re in need of caffeine, and be mindful of what you’re putting in it (i.e. don’t make your coffee into a coffee flavored energy drink by pouring in tons of sweetener!). Buy a reusable water bottle and carry it with you everywhere (bonus: environmentally friendly and money-saving). Don’t like water? Try putting fresh mint, orange, berries, or other fruits in your water for flavor.College students are notorious for not getting enough sleep, but less than six hours a night can throw off hormones that control cravings, appetite, and metabolism. Too few hours of shut-eye can cause your body to crave more of the high-calorie junk foods that it can break down quickly for energy. On nights that six hours is just not possible, try a nap. No time to go home and nap? Throw a scarf or extra piece of clothing in your bag (and maybe some earplugs) to turn your desk in the library into a quiet, dark area for napping.Alcohol is often a big part of social events in college. If your college student is 21 or older, suggesting he or she avoid or limit alcohol will likely elicit a major eye roll. But it’s good to keep in mind that drinking is a calorie-intensive way to spend your time.Alcohol itself packs a lot of calories and zero beneficial nutrients, and can cause increased fat storage in the body and impair hormone regulation, which can in turn throw off sleep patterns and make it difficult to lose or maintain weight or build muscle. If you consider the high-sugar mixers often used to make cocktails and mixed drinks, and that it’s very difficult to estimate a true serving size of alcohol in a solo cup (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, 1.5 oz liquor), you can see how the calories can add up – fast.Alcohol also lowers willpower and inhibitions, and even the diet-conscious student will often break down and devour 3 pieces of pizza at 2 a.m. after a night of drinking. Students who choose to imbibe should keep their drinks simple to help limit calorie content.Avoid using pre-made mixers, energy drinks, and regular soda as mixers to help cut sugar and calories. Try sparkling water and lime juice (or flavored sparkling water) instead and if you need to flavor with juice, try to use only a splash. Consider making your wine into a spritzer by adding club soda and lime (cuts calories and helps keep you hydrated!), and consider switching from regular to light beer, which has about 50 fewer calories per serving.Also, if late night eating is simply unavoidable for you some nights – plan for it. Eat healthy during the day and plan ahead for a healthier late night option. Ideas for easy, more nutritious late night munchies include:Feeling really ambitious? Make your own pizza ahead of time (whole-wheat pita + tomato sauce + shredded low-fat cheese + maybe some spinach for good measure) and just pop it in the microwave when you get home. How to not let alcohol consumption derail your health progress: eat healthfully on the day of drinking but do not skip meals, keep your drinks simple, drink in moderation if you choose to drink, and plan ahead for those late night munchies.College is a balance of working and playing hard and learning what your mind and body need to be happy. With a little extra diet and lifestyle planning, you can help improve your mental and physical well-being and avoid that dreaded “freshman 15” (or sophomore, or junior or senior!) college weight gain.Photo credit: Trinity CollegeAdvice to College Freshmen from Recent GradsProfessor Offers Best Advice to College Freshman Alex Hauspurg, MS, RD is an experienced dietitian.

181,https://www.murdochinstitute.wa.edu.au/blog/things-to-do/5-tips-on-how-to-stay-healthy-while-studying/,"Lots of students make the mistake of thinking that study is more important than your health.Actually, all the research shows that health and brain function are interlinked. If you take care of your body, you’re definitely going to get better marks. It’s time to put away the junk food, step away from your desk and get smart about your brain and body health. We often don’t realise how much our environment affects our health. It’s not just a matter of having clean air to breathe and water to drink; it’s also about the way cities are designed, and what kind of infrastructure is available to you. Cycle routes, for example, are essential to a lifestyle that involves daily biking.The Spotahome list of the world’s most healthy cities has just been released. This ranking was based on criteria like: annual sunshine hours, the rate of obesity, life expectancy, work-life balance, number of fast food outlets, air and water quality and annual holidays.Amsterdam came in at #1, while our very own Perth made the top ten! Perth also came in at #1 for World’s Most Liveable City in 2016! With its beaches, cycling, warm climate and cheap, fresh produce, it’s easy to spend time outdoors, eat well and live a healthy life. Even when you have exams and you don’t have much time to think about food, it’s important to keep eating well and eating regularly. What you eat is ‘fuel’ for your brain, so you want to give it the very best you can.Food needs to have vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fibre to support your gut bacteria. Don’t just go for fast food because it’s easy; pick the healthiest options on your campus. Make sure you have a healthy breakfast every morning and try to avoid too much caffeine and sugar (easier said than done, we know!).As a student, the good news is that eating healthy is actually the cheapest option. Buying fresh produce and cooking your own healthy meals at home saves you money. If you get yourself some lunch containers, you can take your food to school every day! Have you ever tried listening in class when you stayed up the night before finishing an assignment? It’s impossible to concentrate or take in information without a good night’s rest.Make sure you have a regular sleeping rhythm, and choose somewhere to live that’s not too noisy. If you’re sharing a room in student accommodation, some earplugs and a sleeping mask can be priceless. Not only does regular exercise help you sleep and prevent all sorts of diseases, it’s also linked to improved memory and brain function. Doctors recommend at least 150 minutes of medium level exercise per week, such as brisk walking.The good news is that there are always lots of ways to have fun and exercise on campus. At MIT, you can access all the sporting facilities on the Murdoch University campus, including the gym, oval, and sports and social clubs. Time to work up a sweat! It’s just as important to take care of your mental health, as it is to take care of your body. Research shows that having an active social life is just as important as exercise for your brain and life expectancy.Student life can be stressful. You’re juggling lots of different tasks and you can sometimes feel under pressure from exams and assignments.Connecting with friends and other students and talking to each other about life’s ups and downs can be a big help. You can simply reach out to a friend or peer in your class, go out for a healthy juice and chat about whatever’s on your mind.Most importantly, don’t forget to ask for help when you need it. At MIT, there is a range of different counselling and support services available for any students who are having a hard time. Click the various links to read more about living in Perth, student support at MIT and campus facilities.Exams are coming up and you know that your study motivation should be at its highest, but you’re finding it really hard to get in the mood. For new students coming here to study, cultural differences in Australia can range from the way teaching is conducted to how people interact and communicate in and outside the classroom.The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is the most widely used, standardised English proficiency test in the world, with more than three million tests taken each year. Are you considering coming to Western Australia for work or study, and wondering what the job market looks like? Overall, the WA job market is taking a positive turn in the last few years. According to one analysis by 11Recruitment of all online job listings on Seek, the number of jobs posted overall in the Perth region has gone up by 3.4%, between August 2018 and August 2019.

Mining, … ContinuedGoing overseas to study means adapting quickly to a lot of new things at once, so you may be thinking, ‘how could I possibly fit in volunteering as well?’ But here’s the thing.

But, are there any foods that can help you achieve better grades? Does drinking plenty of water really boost your mood and brain power? Studies say what you eat can affect your mood, alter stress levels, irritability and promote calmness. In fact, multiple studies have found a link between a diet high in refined sugars and impaired brain function and worsening of symptoms of mood disorders, such as depression. So, the truth is, adopting a healthy eating habit not just during exam season but every day will keep your body and mind strong. It makes sense! Read: Signs your child is not enjoying schoolHowever, studies also suggest that exam stress makes students crave more for high fat and high sugar snacks. At the same time, increased stress creates a greater need for certain essential nutrients like vitamin C, B5, B6, zinc, magnesium, potassium, etc. These are the nutrients required for the generation of adrenal hormones or the stress-fighting hormones.Also, check out the video below, in which Dr Vasant Mundra, Consultant Psychiatry, Hinduja Hospital, spoke in-depth about exam stress, including the signs and symptoms and how to deal with anxiety during the exams. Whether you are a student or the parent of a child sitting a school/college exam, there are many things you can do to help maintain those all-important energy levels and improve concentration and memory. And eating healthy is one of the most important steps toward this. Here, were have listed some smart diet tips to follow when studying for exams: Read - Parenting tips: Five ways to help your child eat healthierRead - One-third Chinese preschool children online: 5 reasons to monitor your child's internet activityHope the above-suggested tips help.

184,https://healthy-food-choices-in-schools.extension.org/tips-to-create-healthier-school-environments/,"Healthy Food Choices in SchoolsIt is clear that schools can serve as a great venue to encourage healthy eating and physical activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends schools be more proactive in creating healthier school environments. For example, schools can improve the environment by using smarter lunchroom techniques to market healthier food, they can provide comprehensive nutrition and physical education, and they can strengthen their Local Wellness Policies.In the United States, more than one third of children and adolescents were classified as either overweight or obese in 2012. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past 30 years. Overweight and obese children have higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those children who are not overweight or obese. Type 2 diabetes has been shown to be associated with metabolic and cardiovascular complications.The CDC states that healthy eating and physical activity lowers risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes. Children are specifically influenced by many sectors of society, including families, communities, and schools. Schools play an important role in supporting children’s health. They also provide opportunities for students learn about and practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors.As part of a USDA Team Nutrition grant, Michigan created a website that houses Steps to Create a Healthier School (www.mihealthyschools.org).  The Steps to a Healthy School website was developed by a team of experts devoted to improving the health and academic outcomes of Michigan students.  The team came together to collect and suggest resources, curricula, best practices, and funding opportunities to help schools improve their nutrition and physical activity environment. The website and each of the five steps will continue to be updated with new information and resources.The goal of the website is to serve as a one-stop location for schools that walks them through the steps to create a healthier school. The group created a five-step process and embedded vetted resources within each.Creating healthier school environments can be challenging.  However, many resources exist to help parents, teachers and administrators improve the environment.  This website is a good example of how schools can make the healthy choice the easy choice.Da Yeon Shin, PhD, Michigan State UniversityNicholas Drzal, RD, MPH, Michigan Department of EducationD’Adamo E, Caprio S.

Skip the sugary drinks, and go easy on the milk and juice. 8. Eating less salt is good for everyone’s health. Choose more fresh foods and fewer processed foods. 9. Moderate drinking can be healthy—but not for everyone. You must weigh the benefits and risks. 10. A daily multivitamin is a great nutrition insurance policy.

188,https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/healthy-eating-physical-activity-for-life/helping-your-child-tips-for-parents,"In this section:Parents and other caregivers can guide children to develop lifestyle habits that will support their good health for years to come. We know that as a parent or caregiver you may not have all the answers. Like many Americans, you may even struggle to develop and stick with healthy habits of your own. One way to win this double struggle is to practice healthy lifestyle habits—together!Consuming healthful foods and beverages, doing regular physical activity, getting adequate sleep, and other factors may help children toAs a parent or caregiver, you play a big part in shaping children's eating and drinking habits. When you make it a habit to consume foods and beverages that are low in added sugars, saturated fat, and salt and are high in fiber, the children you care for may learn to like these foods as well. If a child you are caring for does not like a new food right away, don't be upset. Children often need to see a new food many times before they will try it.Be a role model. As a parent or caregiver, you also have an effect on children's physical activity. You do not need to be an expert at any activity. Just get up, move, and show children how much fun being active can be. They may grow to like it too. You can set a good example by going for a walk or riding a bike instead of watching TV, playing a video game, or surfing the internet. Find an activity that you enjoy and can do together.Talk about being healthy. As you learn more about how to improve your health, take the time to talk to your children about how a certain food or physical activity may help them. For example, when going for a walk, bring your children with you and let them pick the route. Discuss how walking helps you feel better and is a fun way to spend time together.Use your children's food and beverage choices as teaching moments. Speak up when you see unhealthy choices. Direct children to healthier options or say, ""You can have a little of that, but not too much."" Talk to them about why an overly salty or heavily sugared snack is not the best choice. Avoid making them feel guilty about their food or beverage choices. You can also praise your children when they choose a healthy item like fruit.Use comments like theseWith physical activity, try upbeat phrases like these to keep your child excitedMake sure your child gets enough sleep. Getting enough sleep can improve your child’s mental, emotional, and physical health. Not getting enough sleep may lead to many health issues, including obesity. Find out how many sleep hours experts recommend for your child, depending on his or her age.Believe in the power to change. Know that eating healthy and moving more are the building blocks to better health. Work together to form healthy habits.Promote good health beyond your family. Other adults may play a role in your child's life, too. You can share ideas about healthy habits with them. For instance, many parents and caregivers work outside the home and need others to help with childcare. Family members, day care providers, babysitters, or friends may shape your child's health habits. Talk to them to make sure they offer healthy meals, snacks, and drinks. Check that caregivers are also providing plenty of active playtime and limiting inactive time spent with TV, video games, or other devices.If your child is in school, you can help promote healthy habits in several other waysConsider other influences. Just as they do for you, your children's friends and the media can also affect healthy choices.Some TV, online, and other ads try to persuade children to consume high-fat foods and sugary drinks. You can help your children be aware of these pressures. Speak with your children about choices while you watch TV, surf the internet, or go to the movies with them. Talk about how media outlets and influencers sell products or convey values through famous athletes, child celebrities, cartoon and action figures, and made-up images. Use programs and ads to spark chats about your values. These talks may help your child make healthy choices outside the home.Just like adults, children need to consume foods and beverages that are packed with nutrients. Also, like adults, children should consume just enough calories to fuel their daily living and activities. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest balancing calories you consume with physical activity. The guidelines also recommend improving eating habits to promote health, reduce the risk of disease, and reduce overweight and obesity. Americans ages 2 years and older are encouraged to consume a variety of healthy foods and beverages. Suggested items includeYouth and adults are also encouraged to get lessAdded sugars, solid fats, and salt often occur in pizzas, chips, crackers, sodas, sugar-sweetened drinks, desserts like cookies or cake, and fast foods. If children and teens consume these foods and beverages, these items should be limited on a healthy eating plan.Another step is to make sure your children have breakfast to spark the energy they need to focus in school. Some studies suggest that eating breakfast regularly may decrease children’s chances of developing obesity.1Use less fat, salt, and sugar. Here are some ideas to help you and your child follow a healthy eating planServe nutrient-rich foods and beverages. Many foods and beverages are particularly rich in key nutrients and vitamins—such as potassium, calcium, vitamin D, and dietary fiber—that are important to your children’s health and development. Here are some ideas for boosting your children's intake of these nutrientsThink about the drink.Offer healthy snacks. Along with their meals, snacks can help children get enough nutrients to help them stay healthy. Buy or prepare single-serving snacks for younger children to help them get just enough to satisfy their hunger. Visit the children's section of ChooseMyPlate to help you and your kids select a satisfying snack.Try to keep healthy food in the house for snacks and meals for the whole family. Offer such snacks asKeep two more things in mind when choosing healthy snacks.Share food time together. The key word is “together.”Experts (PDF, 13.8 MB)
 suggest that preschool-age children (ages 3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to help them grow and develop. As a parent or caregiver, you play a big role in helping kids get up and get moving.If you are caring for preschoolers, try to make sure they get about 3 hours of physical activities each day. Those activities could be light, moderate, or vigorous in intensity. If you are caring for school-age children (ages 6 through 17 years), try to get them to do at least 1 hour of physical activity each day. Experts suggest activities that are moderately or vigorously intense. Bicycling, jumping rope, and playing basketball or soccer are some ways for children to be active.There are many ways you can help.Reduce inactive screen time. Sitting for hours at a time, while using computers, hand-held devices, music players, or TVs, may reduce your child's active playtime.Pediatricians suggest limiting the time children use digital media outside of homework time. Between ages 2 and 5, allow your children no more than 1 hour of screen time. For children ages 6 and older, set consistent limits on media time. That will help you be sure they have enough time for physical activity, play, sleep, and other healthy behaviors.3,4Try these tips to reduce your child's screen timeChildren who are overweight are more likely to become adults who are overweight. These children may develop high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and other serious health problems. Weight problems may also lead to stress, sadness, and low self-esteem in children. Because children grow at different rates at different times, it is not always easy to tell if a child is overweight. For example, it is normal for boys to have a growth spurt in weight and catch up in height later.Ask your health care professional to measure your children and tell you if they are in a healthy range for their age and gender. You can also calculate your child's body mass index (BMI), then discuss any concerns with your child's health care professional. BMI is a measure of body fat calculated from weight and height. If your provider tells you that your child weighs more than he or she should, there are ways you can help your child who is struggling with his or her weight.Here are some do’s and don’ts.Remember, you play the biggest role in your children's lives. You can help your children learn healthy eating, physical activity, and other habits to follow for the rest of their lives.[1] Blondin SA, Anzman-Frasca S, Djang HC, Economos CD.

Breaking old habits and creating healthy ones can be challenging and even discouraging at times. However, it’s not impossible.Whether you are looking for a positive outlook on life, wanting to change your diet and eat nutritious foods or you need a new workout plan, our Ultimate Guide to a Healthy Lifestyle discusses different ways you can find a healthier and happier life.Let us help you find a plan that fits your lifestyle needs. Changing to a healthy lifestyle is a common goal, but where should you actually begin? After deciding you want to make a change, the next step is to believe you can actually do it and come up with a plan.What are three lifestyle changes you can make to become healthier?Setting healthy goals is one way to come up with a plan on how to kickstart your new healthy lifestyle.Setting goals gives you something to work for and helps keep you motivated to work hard. By setting goals for yourself you give yourself something to focus on. Additionally, goals allow you to measure your progress and see how much you have achieved.When setting your goals, be realistic with yourself. If you want to quit smoking, lose 50 pounds and run a marathon it’s not going to happen overnight, or it might not even happen in a few months or a year. Not reaching those goals might be discouraging and cause you to give up altogether.Instead, start small and focus on one goal at a time to avoid overwhelming yourself. If you want to lose weight, make small goals on how to do it. Such as working out at least three times a week and adding more vegetables to your plate when you want seconds.Keep a journal or track it in your phone to make sure you achieve those small goals weekly. When those goals just become part of your weekly routine add a new small goal such as only eating out twice a week or adding a weight lifting class to your routine.These small goals are easier to achieve and will eventually lead to meeting your main goal.When many people think of a healthy lifestyle they immediately think diet and exercise and completely ignore mental health. However, mental health is one of the most important factors in creating a healthy lifestyle.“Focusing on how to be mentally healthy and happy is important in any aspect of life,” said Dr. Gregory Dikos, a trauma surgeon at OrthoIndy. “Many of my patients recovering from traumatic injuries experience significant pain and have to endure a lot of rehabilitation before they get better. My patients who practice positive thinking usually feel better sooner.”The ability to manage your feelings and deal with everyday stresses and difficulties can be challenging. Maintaining good mental health means occasionally putting your own needs first. We can’t take care of others if we don’t take care of our own mind and body.If you are looking for a healthier lifestyle, start with your mental health and make sure you are finding time to relax and do things you enjoy, rewarding yourself for accomplishments and spending time with good people who value you.Seeking professional support and treatment is one way to improve your mental health.

This doesn’t mean cutting everything you enjoy from your diet, it’s about balance.Although there are a million weight loss plans that promise to have you shedding pounds while you sleep, the reality is that if you want to lose weight, it will take time, just like it took time to put the weight on.The sooner you take the pressure off of losing a bunch of weight in a short amount of time, the sooner you’ll feel less overwhelmed with creating a weight loss plan that you can sustain.Read about the dangers of extreme dieting for fast weight loss (blog article)How to lose weight naturallyLosing weight is not easy.

Home / Blog / Colleges / 9 Student Tips to Boost Mental Health and Wellness Amid COVIDThis year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic rise in mental health issues. Students are experiencing higher levels of stress and anxiety while also struggling to cope with new ways of learning and feeling connected to others. Mark Sanders, a therapist and Director of Substance Abuse Services at St. Raphael Counseling, has seen a dramatic rise in mental health issues since COVID-19 began. As a therapist for 20 years, Sanders said many of his patients are dealing with situational depression or anxiety brought on by COVID-19. “Essentially all of them are struggling either with the lack of control they have over the situation, the uncertainty (especially around job loss, what their businesses/schools will look like), as well as grief about all of the losses that 2020 has brought about,” said Sanders.  “Stress, anxiety, and depression are unbelievably high right now, and the social isolation that many people feel has exacerbated these issues.”If you’ve been suffering from anxiety and depression, here are some ways to improve your mental health and stay strong this year.Without actively focusing on ways to de-stress, Sanders foresees an increase in the amount of mental health issues. “As the stigma of mental health issues has decreased, more and more people of younger generations (especially men) have found it more amenable to seek out therapy, so I’d have to say an increase is likely. The wildcard is of course, COVID and our societal response—we are a social animal, and if things like the social isolation that has been ongoing for the past few months continues indefinitely, there will absolutely be major increases in depression and anxiety.”If you or someone you know is suffering from anxiety or depression, there are resources available to help, such as the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). Also check with your school counselors for a list of other resources available.Related: Mental Health Resources for College Students On-Campus and Beyond©2020 Peterson's LLC. All rights reserved.

Back to Eat well
These 8 practical tips cover the basics of healthy eating and can help you make healthier choices.The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).Most adults in the UK are eating more calories than they need and should eat fewer calories.Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. Oily fish include:Non-oily fish include:You can choose from fresh, frozen and canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can be high in salt.Most people should be eating more fish, but there are recommended limits for some types of fish.Find out more about fish and shellfishYou need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5.Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:Try to cut down on your saturated fat intake and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies.This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.Many packaged foods and drinks contain surprisingly high amounts of free sugars.Free sugars are found in many foods, such as:Food labels can help. Use them to check how much sugar foods contain.More than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g means the food is high in sugar, while 5g of total sugars or less per 100g means the food is low in sugar.Get tips on cutting down on sugar in your dietEating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much.About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.Use food labels to help you cut down.

193,https://youthincmag.com/10-effective-healthy-eating-habits-for-students,"Students often struggle to eat properly in college, and it’s one of the biggest issues. Good eating means good health but not just in your young years. Eating properly as a young person can also bring you good health in your older years. Even though it’s hard, it can be done. Here’s a few tips that might help you –Colourful food means that you are eating a lot of fruit and vegetables instead of fast food. When choosing what to eat, opt for a rainbow of colours. This is bound to give you a wide variety of nutrients rather than giving you the same nutrients all the time. For instance, go for tomatoes, sweet potatoes, peas, spinach, watermelon, blueberries, and so on. The more colours you mix, the healthier your meal gets.Sugar is the biggest enemy of healthy nutrition. It may give energy at times but that is not the right kind of energy – after a while it will make you drowsy and sleepy. So, sodas, candy and various other sugary goods should be a rarity in your diet. Maybe a birthday cake here and there, on important occasions. However, human body still needs that energy.You can replace it by eating dried fruit, almonds, fresh fruit, dark chocolate or similar replacements that will give you all the energy you need.One of the most sensible ways to lose weight and be healthier is to cut your portions in half. Whatever you used to eat should now be cut in half when it comes to quantity.For instance, instead of 2 slices of pizza, eat just one. Instead of two bags of ramen noodles, eat one. Of course, it doesn’t hurt to improve the quality of meals as well but if you can’t do it right away, start small.Fibre is beneficial for our bodies and our weigh. It can help you with digestion, glucose levels, cholesterol and so on. It can be found in fruit, vegetables, whole grain, nuts and so on. Look for bread that have whole wheat, eat oatmeal and avoid processed food, baked goods and sweets.Fish is something you should eat on a weekly basis. It contains omega-3 fatty acids which improve your health and benefit your brain. Avoid red meats because they contain saturated fats and are not very good for your health. White meats are better – try turkey or chicken – but fish is the best.“Never leave your house without eating breakfast first. Not only does it leave you hungry if you don’t eat it but it can also damage your power to memorize and learn.If you don’t have enough time to eat a proper meal, start storing bagels, juiced, fruits and similar food to eat before going to a class”, – says Dean Baker, a dieting blogger at OriginWritings.Water is essential for your well being. Without it, you wouldn’t be alive. This is why you need to make sure that you intake at least 2litress of water a day or even more when needed. This will help you study, be healthy, avoid headaches and dehydration.Calcium is essential for young people because they need to store enough of it in order to be healthy in their old age. Drink milk, yogurt, eat cheese and green leafy vegetables to make sure you have taken enough of calcium.Most of us get hungry at various times throughout the day. We need to intake some snacks to prevent this and to keep our focus. Students especially have this problem – they study and they get hungry often. That’s why you need to start carrying healthy food in order to stop resorting to junk when you don’t have any around.“Eating too much of anything is bad. Balance is best. So, for instance, eat a meal of fish with sweet potatoes and tomatoes along with some whole wheat bread. As for sweets, mix a bunch of different fruit in one bowl and eat it as a fruit salad”, – says Mel Green, a health writer from 1day2write and Writemyx.Eating healthy as a student isn’t very easy but it can be done. It can even be cheap if you know where to buy food. Do some research, find good recipes and eat healthy while in college.Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

In fact, 46% of freshers miss their mum’s cooking more than anything else from home.When microwave meals and frozen pizzas started to make me feel sick, tired and emotionally exhausted, I decided to take action – and find a diet that was both cheap and nutritious.And I’m not the only one – according to one report, more than a quarter of students put on up to two stone in their first year of university, and others lose weight. Danielle Wenlock, 20, a law student at Bournemouth University, struggled to maintain a balanced diet. “I lost weight because fresh food would go off and fish was expensive,” she says.“I’d bulk buy cereal, porridge and large bottles of milk, which kept me going for the mornings. But I’d cut out meats and fish because I couldn’t afford it.”However, with many students figuring out weekly budgets and frequenting discount stores, almost three quarters of those in the UK say they are eating three good meals a day, according to a survey by Herbalife. I wanted to see if I could manage the same.I’ve now learned that it’s possible to whip up a meal that will keep both your stomach and your bank account full. Here are some tips:Steve Nowottny, consumer and features editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, advises students to reduce the amount of food they waste to save money.“Every student should learn the difference between a use-by date, which is a health warning, and a best-before date, which is usually just the manufacturer’s view of optimum quality. Use your eyes and nose to check – but food that has passed its best-before date is often fine to eat.”There are even stores that specialise in selling food beyond its best-before date at a discount, says Nowottny, and Approved Food does this online.Philippa Hardiman, 20, a music student at the University of Kent, sticks to supermarkets’ sale sections wherever possible. “The discount section keeps me on budget because it’s a much cheaper way to buy meat and veg, which usually lasts just as long as if you’d bought them at full price,” she says.Nowottny also recommends writing a meal plan to make sure you use up the ingredients you already have. “Online services like Supercook or BigOven suggest recipes for whatever is in your fridge or cupboard,” he says.Jayna Rana, 23, a postgraduate journalism student at the University of Kent, says she finds it easier to eat healthily by sticking to a weekly budget. “I write a draft menu for the week and then a shopping list to stop me from buying things I don’t need or accidentally overspending,” she says.",6.8225,10,4.99,9.48,2.82,463

196,https://tutorbin.com/blog/top-7-study-tips-for-students/,"Improving ones grades and performance is an integral part of academic life. Every student is on the look out for top study tips which can help him/her score more while putting in less effort. Most people believe that studying for longer hours is the only way to improve grades and performance. However, the trick lies not in studying more, rather, studying efficiently that reaps maximum results. Ask yourself, ‘If you are able to achieve the same results in 2 hours of study, why would you spend 4 hours on the same”? The idea here is that students must strive to follow study tips that augment their efficiency and not force them to elongate their study time.Table of ContentsA lot of students believe that study tips are over rated and do not have any real world impact on academic performance. This perception is both a myth and a reality. If you search the internet, you will come across many tips and tricks which have no basis and, thus, are unlikely to help improve your grades. However, if you truly make an effort to identify the right tips, you are setting yourself up for success.Why you need study tips for students is easy. These and tried and tested practices which are served to you on a silver platter. However, simply knowing a tip doesn’t guarantee good grades. It completely depends on how well you are able to implement the same as a part of your daily schedule that makes the difference.Now that we understand what study tips are and the importance they carry, it is crucial to learn about the tips that actually work. When you ask around there will be numerous tips that you come across. However, blindly following all will only overwhelm you without creating any real impact. Following are top 7 study tips for students which are highly effective and have been tried and tested by learners across.One of the first study tips for students is to ensure that they do not overburden themselves. Going overboard might get overwhelming, leading to decreased learning. Therefore, it is best to space out your learning. If you try to do all topics at once, you will only end up getting confused, without retaining any knowledge from any topic. It is ideal to take one topic at the time, study it well and then go on to the next one. This is especially true if your topics have any kind of overlap.It is best to have some kind of change between two topics that overlap. Spacing out this way will help you absorb the learning of the first and prepare your mind for what is to come. If you burden yourself with everything at once, you will quickly reach your saturation point and end up worsening your grades.When it comes to study tips for students, this one is very important. While there are certain topics you can just read and excel at, there are others which require more effort. This is especially true to the analytical and objective subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Thus, an ideal approach would be to start your learning by writing. You cannot understand an engineering question by reading it verbally. Once you have conceptual clarity attained through writing, start practicing.Practicing is about solving similar questions to ensure that your concepts are strong and well revised and you do not need to go back to the books time and again. Practicing enough prepares you for the testing stage. Improving grades is not about how well you know the concept, rather how well you are able to reproduce the same in an examination. Testing comes in handy here. Taking tests in a time bound manner will help you manage your time and efforts in a way that plays on your strengths. Thus, you will find yourself with all the necessary resources to improve your grades.Studying in silos can be effective, but at times, there is a need to study with others. This is very true when there are certain concepts that you have grasp over and others which your peers understand well. Therefore, forming study groups is another one of the study tips for students. It works in a simple quid pro quo fashion where you help your friends with some parts of the coursework and they cover the other parts.It might also be a good idea to get support from your family members. If you are learning a particular answer, you can definitely request someone from your family to quiz you once on the same and help you in areas wherever you are going wrong. At the same time, you can seek support for online learning platforms like TutorBin which bring together expert tutors from all across the globe and can assist in your learning. The bottom line here is that support while learning is desirable and should be sought and given.It often happens that when you in mission mode to score well, you lose track of everything else and your health takes a back seat. If you look closely, when you are too involved in studying, you tend to forget eating, drinking or even sleeping on time. While you might think that all the time you save from there, you might put to studying, however, in the longer run, you’re making an unhealthy choice.Thus, one of the top study tips focuses on ensuring a healthy lifestyle while you study. This refers to consuming a balanced diet and keeping yourself hydrated. Without proper nutrition, your brain will not work at its best, causing a slip up while you study. In addition to physical health, you should give importance to your mental health as well. Don’t stress yourself too much and practice meditation to keep all the anxiety at bay.Taking short breaks are important for effective learning. If you study for 8-10 hours straight, what you retain at the end will be quite less of what you actually consumed. Thus, as another important study tip to improve grades, you must take adequate breaks. In fact, you can make breaks as a reward for some learning well done and see it as positive reinforcement. This is not to say that you take a break after every page you cover.What this highlights is the need to give yourself enough time to replenish after an intensive study session to ensure that your learning bears some fruit. If you keep going without taking a break every once in a while, you will hit your saturation point very early on in your study schedule, defeating the whole purpose of following study tips.Being process driven is very important if you wish to improve your grades. It is vital that you have a well thought routine which you follow properly. There is no set routine or process that works for everyone as everyone differs in their learning habits and behavior. What is important is to ensure that you are able to craft a routine and process that works best for you.At the same time, you can explore creating small tricks to help you retain the knowledge you gauge. Acronyms, relationships, mnemonic devices etc. are simple tricks that most learners use and find very effective. Pick up or create tricks that catch your attention and you feel are worth experimenting with.Sitting in the same place, all the time, especially in the wake of the pandemic can be very monotonous and detrimental to learning. Thus, it is a good idea to experiment with changing your learning settings every now and then. You might want to learn one topic in one corner of the room and another at some other place. Even the way you learn can be refreshed. One of the top study tips is to be energized and active which new surroundings can bring to you.Another benefit will be that when you move from one surrounding to another, you will also get physically active which will lead to better health outcomes as well.The above mentioned study tips are all quite effective and drive great results. However, implementing all of them together might be too much of an overkill. Thus, it is best that you start with one or two tips at a time, seamlessly integrate them in your schedule and move onto the next one. The bottom line is don’t blindly follow these tips because they are best practices. Rather, see what works for you personally and can help improve your grades.Your email address will not be published.

Every dollar helps us reach 100 people.Our mission is to provide empowering, evidence-based mental health content you can use to help yourself and your loved ones.healthy eatingIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, eating healthy food remains an important part of maintaining your health. While there are no specific foods that can help protect you from the virus, a nutritious diet can boost your immune system or help you fight off symptoms. You may not be able to share meals with friends and loved ones, but there are lots of other ways to eat well and support your health at this difficult time.Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age. That doesn’t mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs. Learn more »Fat. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline. Learn more »Fiber. Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight. Learn more »Calcium. As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job. Learn more »Carbohydrates are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs. Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline. Learn more »Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals modest can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your diet once a day. As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices.To set yourself up for success, try to keep things simple. Eating a healthier diet doesn’t have to be complicated. Instead of being overly concerned with counting calories, for example, think of your diet in terms of color, variety, and freshness. Focus on avoiding packaged and processed foods and opting for more fresh ingredients whenever possible.Prepare more of your own meals. Cooking more meals at home can help you take charge of what you’re eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food. You’ll eat fewer calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and unhealthy fats of packaged and takeout foods that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety.Make the right changes. When cutting back on unhealthy foods in your diet, it’s important to replace them with healthy alternatives. Replacing dangerous trans fats with healthy fats (such as switching fried chicken for grilled salmon) will make a positive difference to your health. Switching animal fats for refined carbohydrates, though (such as switching your breakfast bacon for a donut), won’t lower your risk for heart disease or improve your mood.Read the labels. It’s important to be aware of what’s in your food as manufacturers often hide large amounts of sugar or unhealthy fats in packaged food, even food claiming to be healthy.Focus on how you feel after eating. This will help foster healthy new habits and tastes. The healthier the food you eat, the better you’ll feel after a meal. The more junk food you eat, the more likely you are to feel uncomfortable, nauseous, or drained of energy.Drink plenty of water. Water helps flush our systems of waste products and toxins, yet many of us go through life dehydrated—causing tiredness, low energy, and headaches. It’s common to mistake thirst for hunger, so staying well hydrated will also help you make healthier food choices.What is moderation? In essence, it means eating only as much food as your body needs. You should feel satisfied at the end of a meal, but not stuffed. For many of us, moderation means eating less than we do now. But it doesn’t mean eliminating the foods you love. Eating bacon for breakfast once a week, for example, could be considered moderation if you follow it with a healthy lunch and dinner—but not if you follow it with a box of donuts and a sausage pizza.Try not to think of certain foods as “off-limits.” When you ban certain foods, it’s natural to want those foods more, and then feel like a failure if you give in to temptation. Start by reducing portion sizes of unhealthy foods and not eating them as often. As you reduce your intake of unhealthy foods, you may find yourself craving them less or thinking of them as only occasional indulgences.Think smaller portions. Serving sizes have ballooned recently. When dining out, choose a starter instead of an entree, split a dish with a friend, and don’t order supersized anything. At home, visual cues can help with portion sizes. Your serving of meat, fish, or chicken should be the size of a deck of cards and half a cup of mashed potato, rice, or pasta is about the size of a traditional light bulb. By serving your meals on smaller plates or in bowls, you can trick your brain into thinking it’s a larger portion. If you don’t feel satisfied at the end of a meal, add more leafy greens or round off the meal with fruit.Take your time. It’s important to slow down and think about food as nourishment rather than just something to gulp down in between meetings or on the way to pick up the kids. It actually takes a few minutes for your brain to tell your body that it has had enough food, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.Eat with others whenever possible. Eating alone, especially in front of the TV or computer, often leads to mindless overeating.Limit snack foods in the home. Be careful about the foods you keep at hand. It’s more challenging to eat in moderation if you have unhealthy snacks and treats at the ready. Instead, surround yourself with healthy choices and when you’re ready to reward yourself with a special treat, go out and get it then.Control emotional eating. We don’t always eat just to satisfy hunger. Many of us also turn to food to relieve stress or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, loneliness, or boredom. But by learning healthier ways to manage stress and emotions, you can regain control over the food you eat and your feelings.Eat breakfast, and eat smaller meals throughout the day. A healthy breakfast can jumpstart your metabolism, while eating small, healthy meals keeps your energy up all day.Avoid eating late at night. Try to eat dinner earlier and fast for 14-16 hours until breakfast the next morning. Studies suggest that eating only when you’re most active and giving your digestive system a long break each day may help to regulate weight.Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A serving is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the amount we currently eat.To increase your intake:While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly become bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes.Add color. Not only do brighter, deeper colored vegetables contain higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but they can vary the flavor and make meals more visually appealing. Add color using fresh or sundried tomatoes, glazed carrots or beets, roasted red cabbage wedges, yellow squash, or sweet, colorful peppers.Liven up salad greens. Branch out beyond lettuce. Kale, arugula, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage are all packed with nutrients. To add flavor to your salad greens, try drizzling with olive oil, adding a spicy dressing, or sprinkling with almond slices, chickpeas, a little bacon, parmesan, or goat cheese.Satisfy your sweet tooth. Naturally sweet vegetables—such as carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, yams, onions, bell peppers, and squash—add sweetness to your meals and reduce your cravings for added sugar. Add them to soups, stews, or pasta sauces for a satisfying sweet kick.Cook green beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus in new ways. Instead of boiling or steaming these healthy sides, try grilling, roasting, or pan frying them with chili flakes, garlic, shallots, mushrooms, or onion. Or marinate in tangy lemon or lime before cooking.Authors: Lawrence Robinson, Jeanne Segal Ph.D., and Robert Segal, M.A.Last updated: June 2020How to Eat Healthy – Small steps to improve your nutrition.

After spending all your student loan on those unnecessary Uber trips, overpriced drinks in the club and shameless online shopping purchases, youâ€™ve found yourself with dwindling funds in the bank and no other choice but to solely survive on the toast and plain pasta you have lying around in the cupboard. Weâ€™ve all been there at some point, but the fact is that eating poorly at uni can have negative impacts on your health, mood, and wellbeing in general. This article will provide you with 5 top tips that will enable you to eat healthily on a student budget (and the best part is you donâ€™t need to be Jamie Oliver to do it!)It is almost certain that in fresherâ€™s week you will be bombarded with flyer after flyer of fast food offers, all claiming that they can offer amazingly cheap deals to students. Companies such as Dominoes and Deliveroo thrive off students who donâ€™t know how (or canâ€™t be bothered) to cook after a busy day at uni. However, frequently buying food from these fast food chains is not only bad for your health, but will also bite a huge chunk out of your weekly budget. Letâ€™s put it this way; if you ordered a medium pepperoni pizza from Dominoes it would come to a total of Â£15.99. Thatâ€™s equivalent to a whole chicken, a pack of minced meat, 12 eggs, a pot of soup, a loaf of multigrain bread, a bag of quinoa, a litre of milk, a bag of cous cous, 6 apples, 6 tangerinesâ€¦ oh, and a deep pan pepperoni pizza from Aldi. Once you start comparing these â€˜amazingâ€™ student deals to the price of food in supermarkets they suddenly start to sound less â€˜amazingâ€™.Whilst at university, the supermarket should be your best friend. Having said that, not all supermarkets are made equal and some may be much pricier than others. Safe bets for your weekly shop would be places such as Aldi, Lidl and Morrisons that pride themselves at balancing good quality with affordable prices. Supermarkets to steer clear of may include Waitrose and M&S (save those for grownups with actual incomes!). If it just so happens that the nearest cheap supermarket is a 7-hour trek up a snowy mountain, through the dark woods and across the blistering desert then consider doing an online grocery shop. Theyâ€™re usually very useful as you:
– Wonâ€™t be tempted by all the chocolate near the till
– Can do a shared order with your flatmates, making delivery costs next to nothing!Flat dinners usually work extremely well. Not only do they get everyone involved and having fun cooking together, but it also works out as much cheaper when the cost of ingredients is split between everyone. For example, a big olâ€™ chicken curry shared between 6 people will easily come to less than Â£2 each! Making a meal from scratch will be much healthier than eating a ready meal or going out to a restaurant as you know everything that goes in, meaning it wonâ€™t contain any nasty additives or hidden calories (yay!). Some examples of healthy crowd-pleasing group meals that are bound to get everyone licking their lips include fajitas, stir fry, Thai curry, pasta bake, one pan rice and soup.So, youâ€™re making a pasta vegetable dish for dinner and you measure out the perfect amount for one portion because youâ€™re the only one eating it tonight. The next day lunch time rolls around and you head to the shop to buy your daily meal deal. Eating habits like this are extremely common but you could save Â£21 a week by bringing in leftovers instead! Making double the amount of dinner wonâ€™t cost much more and requires less effort than buying lunch every day. Furthermore, if you have food prepared in advance, then you are less likely to pick up something unhealthy from the shop. So, consider investing in plastic food containers and start nailing your lunch game whilst saving money at the same time.One thing that proves to be extremely helpful and accessible to students eating healthy on a budget is social media. Facebook contains many pages dedicated to cheap, healthy recipes for students –  some examples include â€˜Mob Kitchenâ€™ (a page containing recipes that â€˜feed 4 for under a tennerâ€™), â€˜The Body Coachâ€™ and â€˜Buzzfeed Healthâ€™. Instagram is another useful source for cheap, healthy meal inspiration â€“ Iâ€™d recommend â€˜onepoundmealsâ€™, â€˜buzzfeedtastyvegâ€™. Pinterest can also provide inspiration for healthy meals as you can search for meals including whatever ingredients you have lying around, this is a great way of saving money as less food goes to waste. Filling your newsfeeds and social media with these kinds of pages will hopefully motivate you to put that little bit of extra effort in and make nutritious, affordable meals, while also realising that cooking can be satisfying and enjoyable!

We're delivering thoughtful, high-quality care for kids who need it: both in person and through telehealth.Portion sizes at restaurants have nearly tripled over the last 30 years. That’s concerning, because busy families are eating out more than ever before. Additionally, sugar-sweetened drinks are popular, and recess and physical education have drastically decreased in schools. Less exercise and increasing access to unhealthy food and drink options are causing many children and teens to acquire poor lifestyle habits that lead to obesity.To avoid the serious and often lifelong health risks associated with childhood obesity, Children’s Colorado’s Head of Nutrition Nancy Krebs, MD, says parents should strive to be role models for their children when it comes to healthy eating and drinking. Browsing the many parent resource articles with pediatric lifestyle tips on our website can help families learn more and feel confident and empowered to create healthy habits.At schoolAt homeSetting regular schedules for healthy eating and physical activity is important, especially for young children, because they’re more likely to adopt them as habits. According to Dr. Krebs, kids respond well to the predictability of regular schedules because it makes them feel secure.Kids need the right kind of energy to sustain their learning schedules. Skipping breakfast leaves them low on energy and focus, and they are likely to overeat later in the day. Eating the wrong breakfast can be just as bad. Pastries and sugary cereal don’t fill them up for very long, and they don’t provide adequate energy for a full morning of school. A healthy breakfast could include a combination of the following:We’ve added two of our favorite breakfast recipes on our Resources page.Although it’s OK to eat out once in a while, eating out regularly may normalize unhealthy food choices and over-sized portion for your kids. Dr. Krebs says that children who eat at home are more likely to eat fruit and vegetables than children who eat many of their meals at restaurants.Cooking meals at home doesn’t have to take a lot of time. Making a plan and having the right kind of food on hand can help. Here’s how to start making quick, easy and healthy meals. When you do eat at restaurants, our nutrition experts can help you understand how to choose healthier options.Children don’t need to eat as much food as adults, but the amount of food they need can vary by age, gender and overall activity level. For example, a two-year-old needs a different portion size than a 7-year-old, and a 7-year-old needs a different portion size than a 15-year-old. MyPlatePlan can give you a general understanding of portion sizes by age, but you should talk with your child’s primary care provider regularly about what is right for your child.Children often consume more when they eat unhealthy food. Often, this food is high in simple carbohydrates, like sugar and fat, which makes them tasty but high in calories. Simple carbohydrates don’t provide the same sense of satisfaction or fullness as a healthy serving size of nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables, meaning children may eat more unhealthy foods in order to feel full.Read about our patient, Brandon, whose family focused on portion control to help him develop healthier habits.Children who drink sugar-sweetened beverages will on average consume an excess of 200 calories a day. Krebs notes that the problem extends beyond soda to include any sugar-sweetened beverage like fruit juice, energy drinks, sweat tea, lemonade and flavored coffees. All of these have added sugar and increase your child’s risk of obesity. Water is the best drink choice, but if taste is the issue, here are 11 tips to try.Fruit has important vitamins and minerals, and also includes fiber, which helps kids feel fuller, explains Dr. Krebs. Kids who drink juice instead of eating a whole piece of fruit often end up consuming more calories. Experts recommend that children drink no more than a small 4-oz serving of juice per day. Offering water (including flavored or sparkling) is the best choice. For a fun snack, try making homemade popsicles out of calorie-free water. Get the tasty recipe from our Resources page.Dr. Krebs advises parents to promote physical activity by encouraging kids to play outside safely. This can include any activity, like biking or hiking with the family, but can also include simple outdoor exploration. The important thing is that children get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day, and it can be helpful to divide that activity into short bursts of 10, 15 or 20 minutes. Allowing kids to play outside, especially with other children, teaches them about taking turns, listening, cooperation, following rules and independence.

203,https://www.myunidays.com/GB/en-GB/blog/article/5-tips-for-staying-healthy-at-uni,"One thing I get asked a lot as I’m always posting healthy foods on my Instagram is how on earth do I manage to stay on a healthy eating plan and train hard whilst at university. Personally, I don’t find it that difficult. Don’t get me wrong, I always get the temptation from the boys on the group chat to grab a takeaway on a Wednesday night then party out till 4am and somehow make my 9am lecture on time. But really, it’s all about finding that right balance and enjoying yourself.I believe with the right balance, it can easily be achieved and I’m going to share with you my simple tips to stay fit, healthy and lean whilst you’re at university.One of the beauties of being at university is that there are so many sports societies. I’m currently in my final year of my undergraduate degree at Nottingham Trent University and their still so many sports societies I would love to get involved in. It’s not just a great way to stay fit and in shape, it’s great way to socialise and meet new people, especially if you’re a fresher. Before you know it, you’re involved in a sport, you're keeping active and enjoying it with your friends!I know this can be quite tricky as many universities will have numerous amount of fast food vouchers being handed around halls and campuses. Let’s be honest, if you get a buy one and get one free pizza voucher, it’s hard to say no. What I always do to help control what I eat, when I eat, how much and the cost of my meals is to meal prep. This is where you prepare your food in advance and take them with you if you have a long day at uni. I won’t lie, it does sound quite boring, but you can jazz up your meals and most importantly, give your body what it needs throughout the day. If you’re stuck for ideas, head to my Instagram for some meal prep ideas.This one ties into the point above and speaks for itself really. Too much eating out can result in them sneaky lbs being added to your waistline which no one wants. My advice, don’t eat out too regularly. If your friends say let’s grab a cheeky bite to eat in the city, there's nothing wrong with that but why not invite your friends around and cook some homemade food together instead. You’ll find it a lot cheaper, funnier as you get to see who’s the best and worst cook and you can control the way you cook your food.This will and forever will be the trickiest subject of them all whilst you’re at university. I will keep it short and get straight to the point. Too much alcohol on a regular basis will not result in a 2017 summer beach body. Just don’t get to carried away with the Koppaberg and tequila and you should be fine.I know sometimes you may be doing an all-nighter in the library for that one assignment that's just becoming Mission Impossible to complete, trust me I’ve been there. But too much of this can result in your diet being out the window and most importantly, your sleep pattern being affected. This can throw off your days, provide you with little energy and it’s a hard habit to break. Try to keep late nights to a minimum or if not, make sure you rest and eat well to recover correctly!

204,https://scholarlyoa.com/healthy-lifestyle-tips-for-adults/,"Genetic heritage, pollution, physical inactivity, smoking, and stress – are just some of the many risk factors that can affect the appearance of many diseases. Some of them can’t be influenced – but many habits can be changed by introducing some of the rules that can contribute to living a healthy and long life. That is why each person needs to decide to change something in their adult life – and accept 10 key tips for long and healthy life.If the 21st century is to be remembered for something, then it is certainly the global trend of adopting healthy habits. Namely, if we took a closer look at what has been happening in the last ten years –  activities such as running and yoga, new eating habits that promote a balanced diet, not skipping breakfast, menus with as many fruits, vegetables, fish and healthy fats would surely be at the top of the list. Also, smoking has become OUT, but not in the sense that it is not in trend. Now it has a much deeper and more meaningful sense – people have realized that it is harmful, shortens life, and causes many life-threatening diseases.Being healthy is the most important thing in our life. It is because without health we are not able to lead a quality life. However, many people today believe that it is impossible to lead a healthy life. Because of such thoughts – a lot of them don’t take care of their health at all. Moreover, they nurture the opposite lifestyles. This is especially true for younger people, who think their health is largely preserved. However, it’s not like that anymore – and nowadays younger people have more and more health issues. Although we are familiar with this disturbing fact – we still mostly continue with the old way of life, until it is too late to do anything for our health. In the following presentation, we will put special emphasis on all those things that can help you preserve your health – and thus the quality of your life.However, it is still important to point out how small daily changes can affect both our happiness and our health. Here’s what you can do yourself. Here are 10 healthy lifestyle tips that you should adhere to if you want to welcome a healthy and vital older age.Cereals, seeds, fruits, vegetables, so-called superfoods, and nuts – these are valuable foods. They should be consumed daily because all together – they are rich in plant proteins, healthy fats, essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and antioxidants. Daily intake of these foods has been proven to reduce the risk of various diseases. Besides eating these foods, avoid complicated recipes. They require you to stay in the kitchen unnecessarily. Instead, turn to simple and healthy recipes – where you will minimize the heat treatment of food. Then you will have much more time for other physical activities.Fresh air has a good effect on our mood and immunity, while moderate exercise is very good for our body. Choose the ones that suit you best. According to humanfitness.net, you should exercise at least 3 times a week. Namely, during exercise, your metabolism grows – and it should remain so for 48 hours. If you take a longer break – your metabolism drops again. It has to stay on that level so you always have energy and be strong. Therefore, it is recommended that you exercise at least every other day. If the weather is bad outside, you can exercise inside. The benefits of physical activity are numerous. People who exercise regularly have more energy, balanced bodyweight, improved blood sugar level, etc. Also, it improves the level of protective cholesterol HDL, reduces blood pressure and the risk of blood clots in blood vessels, reduces stress levels, and even a kind of help in quitting smoking.Water is essential for good health. It also helps regulate weight. The more water you ingest, the faster your metabolism works. Of course, you need to have a measure. If the body is accustomed to not taking water, it stays in the area of the ankles, around the thighs and waist. The moment you start with your daily recommended water intake – those deposits will disappear and you will lose weight. Water also helps with breathing, regulates body temperature, helps with muscle function, transmits nutrients, and removes harmful ingredients. It helps maintain the skin and makes the complexion more beautiful and fresh.Do not take diets in which you will starve to lose weight quickly. Weight loss will be followed by fatigue and constant tiredness. Make sure you consult a nutritionist – and you will get a diet that is tailored to you.Each of us has a different need for sleep. Therefore, it is not possible to establish the optimal amount of sleep that is necessary for every person. Some people need six hours of sleep, while others need up to ten hours of sleep. This also depends on our age, season, as well as our physical activity. The only important thing is to get a good night’s sleep because sleep strengthens your body.If you are often stressed, depressed, or in a bad mood – it will affect your quality of life. You will be accompanied by negative feelings, as well as negative thoughts, which you will often pass on to other people around you. Then you will evaluate each situation negatively, and then you will react negatively in accordance with it. That way, you will enter a vicious circle from which it is difficult to get out. That is why you need to arm yourself with positive thoughts if you want to lead a healthy and quality life.Reduce the use of alcoholic beverages and high-calorie and sweetened soft drinks. One glass of soft drink contains 80-100 kcal, and we often call them empty calories, because they do not provide valuable essential nutrients – and they also contain a large amount of energy.One should laugh and look for a note of comedy in everyday life situations. Each person should laugh for eight to ten minutes a day. Everyone needs to learn to look at life from a brighter side – and must “rise” above many situations.Nurturing good relationships with family and hanging out with friends is something that everyone needs. It should be borne in mind that good relationships with family and friends have a positive effect on people with chronic diseases and encourage healing in patients.Self-confidence is half the solution to the problem. Experts from Harvard University have the opinion that the body is a factory that produces all drugs – but that we must recognize how to activate them. Therefore, make a list of things you do successfully every day.Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Solve Captcha*  −  four  =  three

205,https://www.superkidsnutrition.com/tips-college-students-healthy-weight-management/,"Home | Special Diets | Nutrition and Weight | Tips for College Students’ Healthy Weight ManagementIt’s the new year, and sometimes college students come home during winter break with a few extra pounds. Entering college is a pivotal transitional period for most young adults. College students are prone to practicing unhealthy eating and lifestyle habits, such as pulling all-nighters to finish assignments and study for exams, relying heavily on caffeine, energy drinks, sugar to stay awake, and eating foods that are high in fat and sugar for comfort. In addition, the periods of the most rapid weight gain for adults is in their twenties, which may result in excess weight gain and body fat throughout life.A research study by Greaney et al. showed that male and female students from 8 universities in 8 states stated the same barriers to healthy weight management. These barriers fell into three categories: intrapersonal (e.g., temptation and lack of discipline); interpersonal (social situations); and environmental (e.g., time constraints, ready access to unhealthy food). Facilitators of healthy habits also fell into these same three categories: intrapersonal (e.g., regulating food intake, being physically active); interpersonal (social support); and environmental (eg, university’s environment supports physical activity). Research done by Nelson et al. also identified factors that influenced college freshman and sophomore student’s weight gain, nutrition, and physical activity. Influences on weight and diet included unhealthy food availability on campus, snacking, late-night eating, alcohol-related eating, stress or boredom eating, and food in student dorms. Other factors that hindered physical exercise were negative experiences using campus recreation facilities, poor weather, and lack of time, motivation, and social support.Below are some suggested solutions to help students tackle these interpersonal, intrapersonal, and environmental barriers.In addition to what students can do on their own to overcome these barriers, they need support from universities. It is important for universities to take an active role in offering an environment that promotes healthy weight and behaviors among students!Now get cooking and check out these 8 Quick & Healthy Microwaveable Dorm Room Meals!Get our free guide Say “No” to Food Rewards when you join.We help grow healthy kids, families and communities to create healthier generations!Recognized as a pediatric nutritionist, Melissa also has 20+ years of counseling adults, inspiring them to live their best life at Melissa’s Healthy Living.© 2021 SuperKids Nutrition Inc.

207,https://www.oxbridgeacademy.edu.za/blog/8-tips-for-healthy-eating-on-a-student-budget/,"Select PagePosted by Oxbridge Academy | Feb 13, 2015 | Advice for Students, General | 5  |      For various reasons, we often set healthy eating habits aside, and one of the most prominent reasons is the perceived high costs involved. Eating healthily doesn’t have to empty your pockets, though!Following a healthy diet comes with a range of well-known benefits, including lowering the risk of diabetes and heart disease, maintaining a healthy weight, and supplying your body with the necessary nutrients. The one benefit that is especially great for students, though, is that healthy eating habits can improve your academic performance as well.Healthy eating can be really easy when you stick to eating basic, natural foods – foods that haven’t been processed in any way. These ‘real’ food items include meat (red meat and poultry), vegetables, fruits, nuts, and healthy oils such as olive oil. You will often find that these items are more affordable than foods that have been heavily processed.The next time you go on a shopping trip, challenge yourself to investigate the prices and labels of the items that you buy. When in the bread aisle, for example, compare white bread or regular brown bread to a healthier whole-wheat or low GI bread. Many manufacturers are realising that consumers are much more inclined to buy healthier food items, and have had to adjust their product ranges and prices accordingly.When preparing meals for your family, there are several ways to stretch your budget – especially when it comes to preparing meat dishes. Use canned/raw beans, lentils and soy mince to expand your meal’s nutritional value and to save on your meat budget! You can also increase nutritional value, and make your meals go further, by adding more vegetables to pasta dishes, stews and casseroles.Snacking on fruits and nuts during the day will make you less likely to overindulge when it comes to meal times. Be sure to pack a few snack items in your lunch pack for the day to prevent yourself from buying chips and other unhealthy and/or expensive products on impulse.Always be on the lookout for bulk specials at your local grocery stores. They often slash the prices on bulk items, which will provide you with the perfect opportunity to stock up and save for the future. Items that you can shop for in bulk include meat, nuts, grains, and in-season fresh produce.Always compare the prices for the same products by visiting different grocery stores in your area. You’ll often find that some grocers mark up certain products, while others mark them down – it all depends on their price structures. Plus, visiting more than one store during your shopping trip will have you exercising without even realising it!When in the freezer aisle, look for the largest packages of frozen vegetables. These will probably offer the best value in terms of price. Fresh and frozen vegetables have the same nutritional value, so don’t be afraid to buy in bulk.Once you have planned your meals for the week, make a shopping list and stick to it! This will prevent you from purchasing unhealthy items on impulse.In essence, eating healthily will not only save you money (if you shop smart), but it will improve your overall health and study performance. So go ahead – shop, save and succeed!Share:Rate:3rd June 20203rd November 20177th August 201923rd October 2019Great tips for Healthy diet.Thanks for sharing.Awesome article to keep healthy diet … Thanks for this good piece of work.I really like the tips you share with the readers to keep them aware with the healthy plans in budget.Besides healthy meal, it’s important to have a daily workout routine in terms of exercise, jogging, walking etc. When you do physical practices, it makes you more worry about what food is healthier to eat instead of unhealthy diet.

209,https://www.schooldays.ie/articles/5-tips-for-healthy-eating-when-studying,"Research has shown that the better and healthier we eat the better we feel and the more we can focus at the task at hand. People who rely on sugary fixes too often, drink too much coffee, or eat fatty foods are at risk of being sluggish, jittery or feeling burned out. When studying for exams we can be inclined to stay up late, and forget to eat and drink properly because of the stress.  But bad eating habits before and during exams will leave you with less energy both mentally and physically.

No matter what your diet, vegan, dairy-free, vegetarian or carnivore, good nutrition will always keep you at your optimum and help you concentrate better. So what are the best nutritional and common sense tips for healthy eating around exam time? 
 Dont skip meals.   When you have your head in the books and time is ticking by fast, you might forget or skip a meal to keep up momentum. Don’t do it!  Your brain needs food and water to keep working. Mental fatigue can cloud your brain, especially if you are about to take an exam. Have a quick snack, such as a granola bar, apple, or low fat/carb sandwich to keep you going.
 Eat ‘brainey’ food:  Proteins from lean meat, fish and eggs, fruit, nuts and whole grains are foods that help keep the brain mentally alert. Snacking on nuts and dried fruit as well as keeping Hydrated with water will help stop your concentration from wavering. Remember, fruit like bananas, blueberries, and oranges all have natural sugars that will give you a lift when you’re feeling down and out.
   Eat smaller meals more often.  Large meals tend to make us feel stuffed and bloated, and the idea of 3 meals a day is a modern cultural convention and scientific research opinion is divided. However, our energy levels start depleting around 3 hours after we eat food. Having 5/6 small meals instead of 3 large ones will keep you balanced throughout the day.
 Keep caffeine to a minimum.  Caffeine is great pick-me-up and is proven to help concentration. But too much will leave you jittery and dehydrated. If you’re a coffee addict try and cut back to one a day. 
 Avoid sugar!  Seems obvious, but we are all guilty of eating high fat high sugar snacks sometimes, such as muffins, chocolate, or pastries when we are stressed out and have not prepared any food. High fat/sugar items take time for your stomach to digest and will leave you feeling sluggish. If you have a sweet tooth, why not make a sugary treat part of your rewards in your study planner!

Whether you are studying or about to take an exam, eating right, carrying healthy snacks and plenty of water will greatly aid your concentration levels and give you lots of energy. Remember, a poor diet will affect your sleep, your mood and will leave you struggling to focus, so start preparing your favorite healthy snacks!

210,https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/habits.html,"Whether you have a toddler or a teen, here are five of the best strategies to improve
               nutrition and encourage smart eating habits:Sure, eating well can be hard — family schedules are hectic and grab-and-go
               convenience food is readily available. But our tips can help make all five strategies
               part of your busy household.Family meals are a comforting ritual for both parents and kids. Children like the
               predictability of family meals and parents get a chance to catch up with their kids.
               Kids who take part in regular family meals are also:Also, family meals are a chance for parents to introduce kids to new foods and
               to be role models for healthy eating.Teens may turn up their noses at the prospect of a family meal — not surprising
               because they're busy and want to be more independent. Yet studies find that teens
               still want their parents' advice and counsel, so use mealtime as a chance to reconnect.You might also try these tips:What counts as a family meal? Whenever you and your family eat together —
               whether it's takeout food or a home-cooked meal with all the trimmings. Strive for
               nutritious food and a time when everyone can be there. This may mean eating dinner
               a little later to accommodate a teen who's at sports practice. It also can mean setting
               aside time on the weekends when it may be more convenient to gather as a group, such
               as for Sunday brunch.Kids, especially younger ones, will eat mostly what's available at home. That's
               why it's important to control the supply lines — the foods that you serve for
               meals and have on hand for snacks.Follow these basic guidelines:The best way for you to encourage healthy eating is to eat well yourself. Kids
               will follow the lead of the adults they see every day. By eating fruits and vegetables
               and not overindulging in the less nutritious stuff, you'll be sending the right message.Another way to be a good role model is to serve appropriate portions
               and not overeat. Talk about your feelings of fullness, especially with younger children.
               You might say, ""This is delicious, but I'm full, so I'm going to stop eating."" Similarly,
               parents who are always dieting or complaining about their bodies
               may foster these same negative feelings in their kids. Try to keep a positive approach
               about food.It's easy for food to become a source of conflict. Well-intentioned parents might
               find themselves bargaining or bribing kids so they eat the healthy food in front of
               them. A better strategy is to give kids some control, but to also limit the kind of
               foods available at home.Kids should decide if they're hungry, what they will eat from the foods served,
               and when they're full. Parents control which foods are available to their kids, both
               at mealtime and between meals. Here are some guidelines to follow:Most kids will enjoy deciding what to make for dinner. Talk to them about making
               choices and planning a balanced meal. Some might even want to help shop for ingredients
               and prepare the meal. At the store, teach kids to check out food
               labels to begin understanding what to look for.In the kitchen, select age-appropriate
               tasks so kids can play a part without getting injured or feeling overwhelmed. And
               at the end of the meal, don't forget to praise the chef.School lunches can be another learning lesson
               for kids. More important, if you can get them thinking about what they eat for lunch,
               you might be able to help them make positive changes. Brainstorm about what kinds
               of foods they'd like for lunch or go to the grocery store to shop together for healthy,
               packable foods.There's another important reason why kids should be involved: It can help prepare
               them to make good decisions on their own about the foods they want to eat. That's
               not to say they'll suddenly want a salad instead of french fries, but the mealtime
               habits you help create now can lead to a lifetime of healthier choices.Check out some healthy recipes

Today, students’ lives revolve around their electronic gadgets, studying, and socializing with their friends. Having the highest number of followers on social media, posting memes, and achieving good grades are their priorities. Having a healthy lifestyle and maintaining one is a foreign concept to them.To them, a healthy lifestyle is for self-conscious adults who have trouble with their health. Their young age gets them thinking they are safe to consume junk, alcohol, caffeine, or skip meals. If you are a student, have you been maintaining a healthy lifestyle? If the answer is no, it is time you rethink your health system. To help you with that here is a short list of how you can maintain a healthy lifestyle.A healthy lifestyle involves eating a healthy balanced diet. Do not rely much on your favorite junk, but balance your meal portions with fruits and vegetables. Also, always ensure you have breakfast and avoid skipping meals regardless of your busy school schedule.Also, limit your intake of sugar, carbonated, and caffeinated drinks. Not only will they increase your weight but also have harmful effects on your body. Besides, do not over-eat when you are stressed. If you feel your meals are not balanced, you can always opt to take multi-vitamins to constitute your meal plan.Did you know that keeping fit reduces stress, improves digestion, reduces the risk of dementia, improves sleep, and reduces depression? Besides, it also keeps your body in shape, stimulates the brain, and boosts your self-esteem. Therefore, all students should have a habit of keeping fit.You can do this by joining the school gym or school sports club. Have a workout routine, and you can create one with your friends for a lively experience. Besides, you can substitute the school bus by walking or cycling to keep fit.Every person is advised to consume an average of 8 glasses of water each day. So should you! Drinking water will help you boost your concentration in class. It will also guard against overeating since, at times, the stomach interprets thirst as hunger.Besides, water keeps your muscles energized and keeps your skin nourished. Since partying and binge drinking are considered fun activities by students, always drink plenty of water before and after consuming alcohol. Not only will the water flush out toxins, but it will also keep you hydrated.Partying, staying online on social media, and studying should not keep you awake all week. You should always ensure you get your fair share of sleep regardless of your hectic schedule. Create a study plan and follow it to avoid doing assignments at the last minute.Some students adopt taking caffeine to keep them awake and alert, which may lead to sleep deprivation. To avoid this, have a set time for sleeping and avoid sleeping with your phone. Getting enough sleep will reduce your stress levels, increase your performance, and reduce the chances of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases.Always make time for rest, that way, you’re rejuvenated and ready to work on your duties when you wake up the next day. If you’re overwhelmed with a lot of classwork, assignments, and can barely find time to relax, there’s no need to overwork yourself. You could always hire an expert writing service to assist you with several academic assignments. Simply look up “write my essay” and choose from the myriad of writing companies offering these services. Stress, if not managed, can take a negative toll on your health. It is, therefore, advisable that you find ways to manage it. Taking a walk, swimming, jogging, watching a movie, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy can help you take the break you need.Also, you can avoid educational stress by having a study plan and working on assignments before the due dates to avoid rush and panic. If you need assistance working on a project or essay, you can always pair with a colleague or hire a service. Moreover, being consistent in attending all classes will also help reduce stress and anxiety brought about by exams.A healthy lifestyle involves more than just consuming a healthy diet. Students should always strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle if they expect to remain productive and achieve both their personal and academic goals as well. These tips will help you with just that!Make sure to limit binge drinking, caffeine, and carbonated drinks, get adequate sleep, and keep stress at bay! There will always be one or two things causing you stress. Consequently, you have to learn and adapt to what keeps you relaxed.Share:Rate:Thomas is the webmaster and owner of the websiteOctober 3, 2019July 11, 2018October 20, 2018July 26, 2018info[a]reliablecounter.comAffiliation disclaimer",6.725,10,4.24,9.45,3.21,780

Here are some habits to try that may help you wake up feeling great and ready to conquer your day:(Just be sure to give yourself enough time. This may mean going to bed, and waking up earlier.)Drink this, not thatExperts agree: The first beverage you drink in the morning may have a lasting effect on how you get through your day—not to mention encouraging hydration and maintaining healthy blood pressure.

Think about what fun activities your children can do to get moving and how you can model healthy activity.This doesn’t have to be structured sports. Consider riding bikes to the library, going on an adventure walk or playing tag. Evidence suggests that being active for even as little as five minutes at a time has health benefits. Every minute adds up.Kids (teens too!) thrive on routines. When things are more predictable, it helps everyone feel more organized and reduces stress.

Warren1. Eat a good breakfast.Studies show that skipping breakfast detracts from scholastic achievement. When there isn’t time to sit down and enjoy your morning meal, grab a bagel, piece of fruit and some juice. Most of these items can be easily stored in your backpack.2. If you must eat fast foods, choose wisely.Choose pizza with half the cheese, a regular-size roast beef sandwich, baked potato or green salad with reduced-calorie dressing. Limit high-fat offerings like french fries, fried chicken or fish sandwiches and watch out for salad dressing.3. Keep healthful snacks on hand.If hunger strikes during a late-night study session, you won’t be tempted by candy, chips or ice cream. Possibilities include fresh or dried fruit, pretzels, unbuttered popcorn, rice cakes or whole-wheat crackers. Consider raw vegetables with low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese dip.4. Eat plenty of foods that are rich in calcium.People in their teens need to be build up stores of calcium in their bodies to prevent osteoporosis in later life. If you don’t like milk, try to include ample amounts of low-fat yogurt, low-fat cheese and green leafy vegetables in your diet.5. If you need to lose weight, do it sensibly.Starvation and/or diets that offer a quick fix usually backfire and are harmful. There is no truth to the theories that suggest eating foods in any particular combination will promote weight loss. The only safe way to lose weight, feel good while doing it and keep it off is to eat a balanced diet.6. Use sugars sparingly.Sugar provides calories in your diet but few other nutrients. It also contributes significantly to tooth decay. Use it sparingly and consider sweetening coffee, tea, cereal and fruit with diet sweeteners instead.7. Be wise about the salad bar.The cafeteria salad bar can be either an asset or a detriment to you diet depending on how you choose from it. Of course, leafy greens, raw vegetables and fresh fruits are beneficial. But if you choose a lot of creamy dressing, bacon bits and mayonnaise-based salads, the calories and fat may equal or even exceed those of a burger and fries.8. Drink lots of water.Your body needs at least eight glasses a day, and if you exercise vigorously, you may need more. To remind yourself, carry a water bottle along to class and keep it handy during late-night study sessions.9. Enjoy and savor your meals.Remember, food is a lot more than nourishment for our bodies. Enjoy and savor it.— (NAPS)Wash hands

218,https://www.theschoolrun.com/homework-help/keeping-healthy,"Keeping healthy means doing things that are good for your body – things like eating nutritious foods, exercising, brushing your teeth and getting enough sleep.It’s important to understand how what you eat and what you do affects your body. A balanced diet means that your body is getting all the nutrients it needs. Brushing your teeth at least twice a day helps prevent tooth decay. Exercising for around 30-60 minutes each day means that you’ll stay fit and burn the right amount of calories.All foods have nutrients in them. When you eat something, your body takes in the nutrients that it needs, and gets rid of what it doesn’t need.Remember ‘5 a day’ – everyone should eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day. Are you getting your 5 a day? Here are some things that count as portions of fruit and veg:Fruit and vegetables contain important nutrients for your body. You can get the most variety of nutrients if you choose fruit and veg that are different colours – like a rainbow! For instance, you can eat red tomatoes, orange oranges, yellow bananas, green grapes and blue blueberries. How many other rainbow combinations can you think of?It’s important to drink plenty of water during the day. Your body is mostly made up of water!The foods you eat don’t just affect the inside of your body, they affect your teeth too. Whenever you eat something – especially if it has sugar in it – some of it is left on your teeth. Plaque (a kind of bacteria) breaks down the sugars, which makes the enamel on your teeth soft. The enamel is what’s protecting your teeth, so once that’s gone you can get little holes called cavities that need to be filled by the dentist.You can keep your teeth healthy and prevent cavities by brushing them at least twice a day – front, back, top and even your tongue! Count all the way up to 120 as you brush to make sure that you’re brushing for long enough.Keeping healthy isn’t just about eating the right foods – it’s about getting exercise too. This doesn’t have to mean becoming an Olympic athlete – it just means playing a game of tag outside with your mates, or walking up stairs instead of taking the lift, or trying out for sports at school. You should get 30-60 minutes of exercise every day.There are seven groups of nutrients:We need all of those groups to have a balanced diet, but only certain amounts of each one. For example, you only need a little bit from the fats group, but a lot of vitamins and minerals. If you had a lot of fat, and not enough vitamins and minerals, you’d notice some differences in your body. You’d put on weight, and you might become very tired from not having enough iron or have brittle bones because of not getting enough calcium. A balanced diet is part of keeping healthy.You can keep track of how much of each food group to eat by looking at the GDA, the guideline daily amount. That’s where ‘5 a day’ comes from – it’s the guideline for how much fruit and veg you’re supposed to eat to keep healthy.When you brush your teeth, pay attention to your gums! The same plaque that gives you cavities can also infect your gums – this is called gingivitis. You can keep your gums healthy by flossing in between your teeth and making sure you get as much plaque and food out as you can.The foods you eat all add up to a number of calories. Your GDA tells you how many calories you should have in one day. Calories are what your body uses for energy – you need energy to get dressed in the morning, play with your friends, and take a bath. If you eat more calories than your body needs, you can put on weight.Exercising is a way to burn calories, whether you want to lose weight or just keep healthy. Different activities burn different amounts of calories. Did you know that you burn more calories reading a book than you do watching TV?Watch out for eating too much sugar and salt! Sugary foods have lots of calories and are bad for your teeth. Sugary foods include:Everyone needs a little bit of salt in a balanced diet, but too much salt is bad for your heart. Just because a food doesn’t taste salty doesn’t mean it doesn’t have salt, so always look at the labels. Salty foods include:There are bad things we do to our bodies besides eating too much fat. Smoking cigarettes is one of these things. Cigarettes are little sticks that have tobacco inside them, which can be set on fire at one end (it burns slowly) so people can suck in the smoke on the other end. Tobacco has nicotine in it, which is an addictive drug – it can make someone feel calm and happy, but it’s basically poisoning the lungs and heart. Smoking causes cancer, yellow teeth and nails, asthma and even bad breath.Another dangerous thing people do to their bodies is drink too much alcohol. This is another kind of drug, like nicotine – it’s not addictive to everyone, but it is to some people. It makes people act differently, maybe saying things they wouldn’t normally say or doing things they wouldn’t normally do. Drinking alcohol affects the liver, which is an organ in your body that filters out bad things from your blood. It can also cause damage to the brain and heart.5 a day – an easy way to remember how many portions of fruit and veg you must have in a day!Calories – the amount of energy that a food has; if you eat too many calories, your body can’t burn it all off as energy during the day, and it can turn into fatCarbohydrates – a large part of a balanced diet to give energy and fibre; includes breads, pasta and potatoesDiet – the name for all of the food that you eatEnzymes – help to break down food to help the body absorb the nutrientsExercise – all kinds of activity that helps keep your body fit and healthyFats – a source of energy, and something that helps the body absorb certain nutrients; you only need a small amount of fat in a balanced dietFood label – a little guide on each kind of food you buy that shows what’s good and bad about it; traffic lights tell you if it’s got good (green) amount of salt, an okay (yellow) amount of sugar, or a bad (red) amount of fatGDA – stands for ‘guideline daily amount’, the amount of each food group that is recommended for keeping healthyNutrient – compounds in foods that are essential for health and provide us with energyVitamins – one of the body’s essential nutrients; vitamins can be found in fruits, vegetables, meats, grains and dairy products           Have a closer look at the seven food groups, and how they are digestedBecome a Food Detective with Change4Life activities for Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 (there are even certificates to fill for top detective work!)Use the free Sugar Smart app to find out how much sugar is hiding in the food you eat every dayRead about dairy foods with booklets from the Dairy CouncilLearn to love vegetables with free See & Eat ebooks: each one shows a different vegetable’s journey from farm-to-fork.

 What does being a healthy teacher mean? Based on the way I used to live, I can definitely tell you what it doesn't mean. For starters, it doesn't mean grabbing Cheetos and Coke in the morning and calling it breakfast. Nor does it mean buying candy and fudge every time a student comes by for a fundraiser.But there's more to it than just your nutrition. Healthy teachers don't sit at their desks, grading for hours on end without moving, and they don't lie awake at night obsessing over every single thing they forgot to do that day and every single thing they have to do tomorrow. So yeah, I was nowhere near healthy.It's far too easy to fall into bad habits. During my first two years of teaching, I gained 40 pounds. I was no longer walking a mile each day to get to my job, and because I had too much work to do, I never went to the gym. With only 20 minutes to eat lunch, I grabbed whatever was quick and fueled myself with soda and candy to get through the day. It wasn't good for me, and I knew I couldn't keep it up. I'm working to get back to health and happiness, and if you want to join me, here's how.
I recently devoured the book How Not to Die by Michael Greger, a physician and founder of NutritionFacts.org. Dr. Greger's scientifically supported book outlines a diet aimed at preventing and reversing many diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and high blood pressure. The diet is plant-based and focuses on Dr. Greger's ""daily dozen,"" a list of foods we should eat every day. It includes beans, berries and other fruit, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, greens and other vegetables, flaxseeds, nuts and other seeds, whole grains, spices (like turmeric, marjoram, and cayenne pepper), and beverages like water, coffee, and tea.The list's final item is exercise, which isn't a food, but Dr. Greger believes you should get in one ""serving"" of 90 minutes a day. Since heart disease and cancer run in my family, I've been working to add the ""daily dozen"" to my diet. It really hasn't been that hard—as long as I follow the next step.If I don't plan out my lunches, I end up in the teachers' cafeteria eating shepherd's pie three times a week. So I force myself to head to the grocery store and pick up ingredients for slow-cooker meals and delicious salads. I even grab some quick, healthy frozen entrees for those inevitable days when I'm too tired to prep my food ahead of time. When you know what you're going to eat each day, you're less likely to reach for something easy and unhealthy.Further reading: 5 REALISTIC Ways for Teachers to Get Healthier This YearThere have been studies that show that willpower gets stronger the more it's exercised. Each time you resist that candy box, you're actually strengthening yourself for the next time around! Just be careful. Those same studies say you can wear out your willpower if it's used too much, so try to limit the challenging situations you face.You absolutely MUST make time in your day to exercise. I know how hard this can be. I recently bought a fitness tracker, and it's been extremely helpful to ensure I'm getting my ""steps in."" Competing with other teachers and even students in our building has motivated me even more. To make sure I reach my goal, I'll use the second-floor copier or deliver a message in person rather than through e-mail.Lifting weights will eventually become part of my exercise routine. Essential for maintaining muscle mass and strength, weight training helps prevent the risk of falls and fractures, and it increases metabolism.While we all know how important sleep is for our students, we often forget that it's a huge factor in our health as well. As you get older, you sleep much less. Sure, you might fall asleep at 8:30 p.m., but you find yourself wide awake at midnight, unable to go back to sleep. A lack of sleep raises stress levels and causes a litany of health issues.Eight ounces of tart cherry juice, which has melatonin, can help you sleep better. Exercising and laying off the caffeine go a long way toward helping you sleep as well. It's also beneficial to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up the same time in the morning — even on the weekends!Practicing mindfulness and meditation can help you cope with the stresses of the day. Stress can have an enormous impact on your health, causing chest pain, headaches, and sleep issues, so it's important to find the right coping techniques.Meditation is very effective in dealing with stress and increasing focus. While it can be especially hard to calm a teacher's mind, there are several apps that can help with meditation and mindfulness. I find listening to Tibetan bells to be particularly soothing.Further reading: Exercise and the Brain: How Fitness Impacts LearningToo often, teachers' lives revolve totally around school. We absolutely must force ourselves to make time for ourselves to energize and regroup. Whether you actually schedule 10 to 30 minute blocks of ""me time"" in your calendar or just dedicate yourself to a little quiet recentering when you get home, it will really pay off to keep your energy focused solely on yourself at times.Teaching is an extremely stressful job, and there are plenty of reasons to make bad choices. Don't go down the same path I did. Take control now, so you'll always be a healthy teacher who's ready to tackle any challenge and face each and every morning with a burst of energy and a big, healthy smile.Nancy Barile is a National Board Certified Teacher, who has been teaching English Language Arts at a low-income, urban high school near Boston, MA for 22 years.

Healthy NutritionYouthWhat is healthy eating?Eating healthy is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and is something that should be taught at a young age. The following are some general guidelines for helping your adolescent eat healthy. It is important to discuss your adolescent's diet with his or her health care provider before making any dietary changes or placing your adolescent on a diet. Discuss the following healthy eating recommendations with your adolescent to ensure he or she is following a healthy eating plan:Making Healthy Food Choices.The MyPlate icon is a guideline to help you and your adolescent eat a healthy diet.

Getting Adequate SleepYouthSleep is food for the brain. During sleep, important body functions and brain activity occur. Skipping sleep can be harmful — even deadly, particularly if you are behind the wheel. You can look bad, you may feel moody, and you perform poorly. Sleepiness can make it hard to get along with your family and friends and hurt your scores on school exams, on the court or on the field. Remember: A brain that is hungry for sleep will get it, even when you don’t expect it. For example, drowsiness and falling asleep at the wheel cause more than 100,000 car crashes every year. When you do not get enough sleep, you are more likely to have an accident, injury and/or illness.Facts:  Solutions:Source: The National Sleep Foundation, Teens and Sleep: https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/teens-and-sleep Young Adults/AdultsNational Sleep Foundation’s Sleep Duration Recommendations: AgeRecommendedMay be appropriateNot recommendedNewborns0-3 months 14 to 17 hours11 to 13 hours18 to 19 hoursLess than 11 hoursMore than 19 hoursInfants4-11 months 12 to 15 hours10 to 11 hours16 to 18 hoursLess than 10 hoursMore than 18 hoursToddlers1-2 years 11 to 14 hours9 to 10 hours15 to 16 hoursLess than 9 hoursMore than 16 hoursPreschoolers3-5 years 10 to 13 hours8 to 9 hours14 hoursLess than 8 hoursMore than 14 hoursSchool-aged Children6-13 years 9 to 11 hours7 to 8 hours12 hoursLess than 7 hoursMore than 12 hoursTeenagers14-17 years 8 to 10 hours7 hours11 hoursLess than 7 hoursMore than 11 hoursYoung Adults18-25 years 7 to 9 hours6 hours10 to 11 hoursLess than 6 hoursMore than 11 hoursAdults26-64 years 7 to 9 hours6 hours10 hoursLess than 6 hoursMore than 10 hoursOlder Adults≥ 65 years 7 to 8 hours5 to 6 hours9 hoursLess than 5 hoursMore than 9 hoursSource: National Sleep Foundation, Recommends New Sleep Times, https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-timesHabits to Improve Your Sleep.There are some important habits that can improve your sleep health:Source: CDC, Tips for Better Sleep.  https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/sleep_hygiene.html 4. Controlling StressYouth Part 1: Tackling the Problem Point 1: Identify and Then Address the Problem.First decide if a problem is a real tiger or just feels like one. If it can't hurt you, chances are that it can be better handled with clear thinking. This means turning off those thoughts that make you interpret the situation as a disaster.Three ideas can help you manage a lot of work.Point 2: Avoid Stress When Possible.Sometimes we know exactly when we are headed for trouble. Avoiding trouble from a distance is easier than dealing with it up close. You know the people who might be a bad influence on you, the places where you're likely to get in trouble, and the things that upset you. Choose not to be around those people, places, and things that mess you up. Point 3: Let Some Things Go.It's important to try to fix problems, but sometimes there is nothing you can do to change a problem. For example, you can't change the weather, so don't waste your energy worrying about it. You can't change the fact that teachers give tests, so just study instead of complaining about how unfair they are. You can't change the fact that your parents need to know where you go, so prove that you're responsible and deserve more freedoms. People who waste their energy worrying about things they can't change don't have enough energy left over to fix the things they can. Also learn when not to take things personally. You feel badly for no reason when you take something personally that really has little to do with you. Part 2: Taking Care of My Body Point 4: The Power of Exercise.Exercise is the most important part of a plan to manage stress. When you are stressed, your body is saying, ""Run!"" So do it. Exercise every day to control stress and build a strong, healthy body. You may think you don't have time to exercise when you are most stressed, but that is exactly when you need it the most. If you are stressed about an assignment but too nervous to sit down and study—exercise! You will be able to think better after you have used up those stress hormones. Some people exercise before school so they can focus and learn better. Point 5: Active Relaxation.You can flip the switch from being stressed to relaxed if you know how to fool your body. Because your body can only use the relaxed or emergency nervous system at any one time, you can turn on the relaxed system. You do this by doing the opposite of what your body does when it is stressed. Here are 2 ideas.Point 6: Eat Well.Everyone knows good nutrition makes you healthier. Only some people realize that it also keeps you alert through the day and your mood steady. People who eat mostly junk food have highs and lows in their energy level, which harms their ability to reduce stress. Instead of eating greasy or sugary foods, eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—they keep you focused for a longer time. Go to ChooseMyPlate.gov to learn more. Point 7: Sleep Well.Most kids don't get the sleep they need to grow and think clearly. Tired people can't learn as well and can be impatient and irritable. Here are some ideas to improve your sleep.Part 3: Dealing with EmotionsPoint 8: Take Instant Vacations.Sometimes the best way to de-stress is to take your mind away to a more relaxing place.Point 9: Release Emotional Tension.Sometimes feelings become so overwhelming that we cram them all away in an imaginary box and think we'll deal with them later. But later, there's so much stuff in the box that there is too much to deal with. This can make your head feel as if it is spinning. Sometimes you get angry or frustrated without even knowing why. You just know there is too much stuff going on in your head. It's good to pick just one problem to work on and forget the rest for the moment. When we decide to deal with only one problem at a time, it's much less scary to open the box.Here are some ideas to release your thoughts or worries one at a time.Part 4: Making the World BetterPoint 10: Contribute to the World.Young people who work to make the world better have a sense of purpose, feel good about themselves, and handle their own problems better. It's important to understand that you really can make a difference in other people's lives. The role of teenagers is to recognize the mistakes adults have made and build a better world.Source: HealthyChildren.org, For Teens: Creating Your Personal Stress-Management Plan: https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/For-Teens-Creating-Your-Personal-Stress-Management-Plan.aspxAdditional Source: CDC, Coping with Stress: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/copingwith-stresstips.htmlYoung Adults/AdultsHere are four simple techniques for managing stress:Negative self-talk increases stress.

Goal SettingYouth﻿Recommendations from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Healthy Schools includes a standard (number 6) that ""Students will demonstrate the ability to use goal-setting skills to enhance health."" Rationale: Goal-setting skills are essential to help students identify, adopt, and maintain healthy behaviors. This standard includes the critical steps that are needed to achieve both short-term and long-term health goals. These skills make it possible for individuals to have aspirations and plans for the future.Pre-K-Grade 26.2.1        Identify a short-term personal health goal and take action toward achieving the goal.6.2.2        Identify who can help when assistance is needed to achieve a personal health goal.Grades 3-56.5.1        Set a personal health goal and track progress toward its achievement.6.5.2        Identify resources to assist in achieving a personal health goal.Grades 6-86.8.1        Assess personal health practices.6.8.2        Develop a goal to adopt, maintain, or improve a personal health practice.6.8.3        Apply strategies and skills needed to attain a personal health goal.6.8.4        Describe how personal health goals can vary with changing abilities, priorities, and responsibilities.Grades 9-126.12.1       Assess personal health practices and overall health status.6.12.2       Develop a plan to attain a personal health goal that addresses strengths, needs, and risks.6.12.3       Implement strategies and monitor progress in achieving a personal health goal.6.12.4       Formulate an effective long-term personal health plan.Source: CDC Healthy Schools, Standard 6: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/sher/standards/6.htmYoung Adults/Adults None Available. 6. Mental WellnessYouthThe term youth is generally defined as ages 0 – 20, completely encompassing the unborn up into young adulthood. More so than any other age category, youth vary greatly regarding what they need to be healthy depending on where they are developmentally. ﻿﻿ These facts and recommendations are for professionals and parents by the American Mental Wellness Association.Middle Childhood (ages 6 – 8)Biophysical: A healthy diet never goes out of style, regardless of age. Children should also be getting plenty of exercise. This is a great age to enroll children into athletics to foster team building, confidence, and physical fitness/Psychological: Friendships are starting to become more important at this stage. There is an intense desire to be liked by peers, and children will start to think about their futures and where their place is in the world.Social: Friendships become more important during this stage as children have an intense need to be liked. Children may fall into peer pressure more easily during this stage, so it is important to talk to children about how to handle peer pressure. Bullying may also become a problem during this stage.Spiritual: If being raised in a faith-based home, children in this stage may start having questions about the beliefs of the family. Children may begin to wonder what their purpose is, or have questions such as what happens after you die. Late Childhood (ages 8 – 11)BioPhysical: Healthy diet and exercise, physical changes during puberty (especially for girls), increased awareness of body.Psychological: If there is a history of mental health problems in the family, now is when they may begin popping up.Social: Friendships are becoming more complex, and it is becoming more important for strong peer relationships. Parental relationships are still important though – children need to know that as life becomes more complex, they still have the support and love of their parents to fall back on.Spiritual: A lot of questioning and doubts occur during this stage, which is healthy and normal. Children should be encouraged to think through their doubts and form their own opinions with healthy guidance from parents.Young Teens (ages 11 – 14)BioPhysical: Keep on keeping on with the good diet and exercise. This may become more difficult as teens naturally need to eat and sleep more, thus it may be harder to fit in healthy choices and enough physical activity. Stress from school and homework may also contribute to less-than-desired sleep.Psychological: The need to fit in with peers and be accepted causes friction with the need to be unique and find their own identity. Young teens may start to develop that classic teenage attitude. Strict discipline is not as effective as it was as a child anymore; teens need to understand the whys behind actions and decisions.Social: Young teens continue to develop complex relationships, perhaps finding interest in romantic partners and dating. Increased peer pressure to experiment with drugs or sex are additional conversations that should be had with parents.Spiritual: Young teens are much more aware of their futures. Schools may offer aptitude tests, which may stress young teens out more than they help. Mounting pressure to decide on a career begins to really take shape as teens enter into high school and are expected to select classes to cater to their career interest. The push for good grades to get into college also increases during high school. This can be the source of a lot of stress. Young teens should be reminded that they do not need to have their careers mapped out by graduation.Teenagers (ages 15 – 20)BioPhysical: Teenagers need more sleep and more food during this important stage of their lives. Continue to promote healthy choices and regular exercise.Psychological: Pressure to be the best explodes during this time. Stress from school, extracurriculars, and work push students to their limits.Social: Dating relationships definitely start to take hold during this time. Heartbreak, cheating, and other social traumas may begin to take their toll. 1 in 3 teenagers will be in an unhealthy relationships. If you haven’t already, have conversations now surrounding dating violence.Spiritual: Teens may feel distress regarding their futures. Most teens only have rough ideas of what they want to do with their lives by graduation; and even then about 80% of college students end up changing their major at least once. Beliefs about faith and spirituality begin to solidify around this time, but are certainly still malleable.Source: The American Mental Wellness Association, Healthy Youth: https://www.americanmentalwellness.org/prevention/healthy-youth/Young Adults/Adults None available. 7.

	800-ACP-1915 (800-227-1915) or 215-351-2600Hey y’all!We’re the twins, Stacey and Tracey! Being happy and healthy is one of our mottos, so we try to do what we can despite anything that comes our way.How do you become happy and healthy? That’s what we’re here for! Tracey wrote an article published in the September 2014 IMpact newsletter edition titled “10 Tips on How to Be Happy in Medical School.” Feel free to read and share those tips. After getting lots of positive feedback from around the world, like the Caribbean, Egypt, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Texas, we decided to come up with more tips to help fellow medical students. Here are some ways you can be healthy in different aspects of medical school and beyond. Enjoy!Be Emotionally Healthy
	Smile and be happy (read Tracey’s “Happy” article).
	Say “please” and “thank you.” Physicians, professors, patients, and interprofessional staff are all part of your learning, so it’s a nice gesture to let others know you are grateful for allowing them to be a part of your learning experience.
	Reward yourself. After an exam, a challenging week, or being on call, it’s nice to relax. Examples of how you can treat yourself include a massage, karaoke, laser tag, and sleep!
	Build a tough skin. Although we would like to think that everyone has some good in them that is not always the case. Some people may have a negative personality and may say hurtful or embarrassing things to you. Don’t let negative people get to you. Realize it may happen, mentally prepare yourself if it does happen, stay professional in the heat of the moment (easier said than done!), and don’t take it personally. If need be, talk about the incident with someone you trust.Be Physically Healthy
	Munch healthily. Be aware of what you’re eating, and keep healthy snacks around. All that studying requires some good food to keep you going.
	Exercise. Although it is ideal to get about 30 minutes of exercise every day, not everyone can keep to that schedule. So integrate exercise into your day. Take the stairs. During breaks, brisk walk with a friend, do yoga, or do 5-minute exercises on YouTube. When you need to go to the bathroom, use the bathroom at least a floor above. If watching a video, stand up and walk in place. Some exercise is better than none. And, if you have time, definitely do some cardio, strength exercises, powerlifting (like us!), sports, etc., to keep your body moving.
	Sleep. A good night’s sleep helps in memory, energy, and quality of life.Be Academically Healthy
	Promote a nurturing environment. We are all going to be doctors, so start now to foster a supportive and collaborative environment.
	Actively study. Whether you take notes, make flashcards, draw diagrams, or teach a classmate, be active in your studying. If you like to study with people, find a group of friends you can rely on and trust.
	Be open to asking others for help and offering to help others.
	Take study breaks. Smaller and manageable study sessions may help. During those breaks, do something you feel good about, like a walk outside for some sun, a munch break, or quick meditation session.Be Extracurricularly Healthy
	Make time for organizations, projects, events, and hobbies you enjoy but don’t overload you. Balance school with other activities. Don’t feel like you have to constantly study. It is okay to enjoy life, too.
	Volunteer. Engaging in community service allows you to give back to others.
	Lead. Being a leader does not mean you have to be president. If you can get a leadership position, great! If not, there are other ways to lead. Help with a project, be responsible, and work with others to reach a common goal.
	Keep track of your activities, and update your CV with the name of the activity, description, contact person, and number of hours.Be Socially Healthy
	Surround yourself with positive people.
	Have a strong support group of family, friends, and mentors.
	Follow the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Treat others with respect, kindness, and care. If you don’t agree with people, it’s okay, but stay professional. No need for drama. Keep in mind that your personality and reputation will follow you and that people talk.Be Spiritually Healthy
	Meditate and do deep breathing exercises. Close your eyes and take one long, deep breath. Open your eyes. Feel better?
	Self reflect. What did you do great today? How can you improve? What are you grateful for?
	If your faith is important to you, do what you feel is right for you to keep that spiritual side of you alive.Be Professionally Healthy
	Be involved in interest groups. Go to meetings, attend grand rounds, shadow, research, and volunteer.
	Find a mentor. Don’t know any? Be proactive like us and e-mail people you are interested in shadowing or doing research with.
	Talk to upperclassmen, residents, and faculty if you need advice. Utilize resources at your school and on the Web. You are not alone.
	Work well with others. Be humble, and don’t look down on others because they are not doctors. Medicine is a team sport, and interprofessionalism in patient care is critical. You can learn something from everyone.
	Keep your cool and stay professional.If you found this helpful or know someone who would benefit, please share these tips with them. Feel free to e-mail us to say hello, let us know how our tips have helped you, and suggest future articles. We would love to hear from you!Until then, good luck on your medical journey. In Spanish, we say, “todo vale la pena” (it will all be worth it), so keep on powering through. And, of course, may you be happy and healthy!Tracey Isidro

			From drinking more water  to eating a balanced diet, our GP reveals his top tips for a healthy lifestyle.We all know that a healthy lifestyle can prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses, and boost mental health. But with so much information available, and so many passing health fads (hello, celery juice!), it can sometimes feel difficult to determine exactly which healthy habits are worth investing in if we want to live longer and healthier lives.If you've been struggling to get into a new and healthy routine in 2020, you're not alone. When we feel stressed or overwhelmed, we often start to neglect our basic needs, whether that means sleeping less or eating more junk food than usual. If this sounds like you, it might be time to go back to basics, whether that is drinking more water or exercising more.We spoke to our resident GP Dr Roger Henderson to get his advice on the healthy lifestyle choices that will have a big difference on our health:When we’re born, almost 97 per cent of our body is made up of water. As adults, this figure falls slightly but still sits somewhere around 75 per cent. The vast majority of our brain cells are simply water, and even our teeth have 10 per cent water content. Every single cellular function in our body is in some way linked to our fluid levels: blood and cancer-fighting immune systems require water to flush out waste products away from cells and to transport nutrients and vital amino acids into them. Healthy cells work by absorbing nutrients from the water that bathes them, and even 2 per cent body dehydration is said to cause energy levels to drop by one fifth! Pay attention and notice your thirst – drink water (ideally, although tea and coffee is fine) on and off throughout the day to help keep your body at an optimum hydration level. Although there’s no simple answer as to what’s the ‘normal’ amount of sleep, most adults should aim for between seven and nine hours a night. It’s during sleep that your body restores, heals and strengthens itself both physically and mentally and a good sleep routine is important for good health.  It’s during sleep that your body restores, heals and strengthens itself physically and mentally.A balanced diet doesn’t need to be difficult or complicated – the general key is to eat the right number of calories for how active you are. If you eat or drink too much, you’ll put on weight. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight. The average man needs around 2,500 calories a day and the average woman needs 2,000. Eat a wide range of foods to ensure you’re getting balanced nutrition. If you need to lose weight, do it. The UK is fast becoming the most obese country in Europe, thanks to poor diets and lack of exercise. Eating a healthy, balanced diet plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy weight, which is an important part of overall good health. Being overweight or obese can lead to health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease, and stroke. Physical activity can help you to maintain weight loss or be a healthy weight but being active doesn’t have to mean spending hours at the gym: try getting off the bus one stop early on the way home from work and walking, or taking the stairs at work rather than the elevator. Just find something active you enjoy doing – whether it’s cycling, running, dancing or gardening – and do more of it.Giving up smoking is probably the greatest single step you can take to improve your health. About half of all smokers die from smoking-related diseases. If you are a long-term smoker, on average, your life expectancy is about 10 years less than a non-smoker and only about half of long-term smokers live past 70. The younger you are when you start smoking, the more likely you are to smoke for longer and to die early from smoking. Smokers who quit before the age of 45 have a life expectancy close to that of people who have never smoked. For people above this age, the gap widens, but smokers who quit over the age of 45 still enjoy considerable health benefits over people who continue to smoke. 
Medication non-compliance – the failure to take drugs on time in the dosages prescribed – is a huge problem both in the UK and other countries. Although hard facts are a little tricky to come by for obvious reasons, it has been estimated that at least 50 per cent of patients fail to comply with long term drug therapy, leading to poor control of their medical conditions and all the associated risks that go with that. You always need to take medications as instructed by your doctor – even if your symptoms subside. If you have any concerns about why you’re taking a certain medication, don't stop taking it but talk your concerns over with your doctor.Washing your hands is one of the most effective contributions you can make to public health – second only to vaccination in terms of effectiveness at reducing infection. Use hot water and soap (or an alcohol hand cleaning gel if this is impractical) to wash your hands after preparing food, going to the toilet, blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing into your hands, after handling household waste, before preparing food or eating, when caring for a sick person, or when inserting or removing contact lenses. People used to associate a deep tan with good health, but it’s actually a sign of serious skin damage. The rising numbers of skin cancer cases in the UK – especially in the young – show the price that can be paid. Using tanning beds further increases this risk. People most at risk include those with fair skin (especially people with blonde or red hair with freckles) and those who have been sunburnt in the past (especially with blisters, and even if this happened many years previously). If you have more than ten moles, your risk increases as does using sun beds – or if there is a history of skin cancer in your family.A deep tan is actually a sign of serious skin damage.We all get stressed from time to time, but chronic stress is not only bad for your health in general, it can prevent you from relaxing even when you have the chance to. Using relaxation techniques can help relieve the symptoms of stress as well as helping to defuse stressful situations, allowing you to take charge of your emotions and clear your head. All relaxation techniques combine breathing techniques along with muscle relaxation and it can take time to learn these skills – don't worry if it seems strange at the start. Keep practising and it will come. Some people find that going to yoga or tai chi classes are a good way of improving both breathing and relaxation.Last updated: 13-08-2020",7.1525,9.82,5.19,9.46,4.14,1183
224,https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/local/silverton/2020/12/23/tips-children-stay-healthy-during-pandemic/3960235001/,"Children across Oregon have endured physical and emotional challenges during recent COVID-19 closures, which has led to a lack of exercise and stress eating according to public health experts.Childhood obesity has increased following COVID-19 restrictions on schools, youth sports, and parks. In Oregon, nearly 30% of teens are overweight or obese according to state figures. Pediatric specialists also note there is an increase in Type 2 diabetes in children during this same time.While distance learning may be new for most families, providing full-time online public school to students’ homes is what Willamette Connections Academy is all about. I encourage students to use the flexibility of virtual education to take breaks for a healthy snack or physical activity and return to assignments ready to focus. Children can build healthy eating and exercise habits while still learning from home.Parents should set a good example for kids with healthy food choices. Stock up on healthy fruits, vegetables, and whole grains for healthy snacking and eat meals together. Research shows youth who eat the same healthful food as their parents tend to have healthier diets. Make it fun by trying out new recipes.Children are more likely to eat healthier items if parents avoid calling foods ""good"" or ""bad"". Teach kids the benefits of nutritious foods using phrases like, “Eating oranges are great to prevent colds.”Talk about why sweet treats are great for holidays and birthdays, but parents should emphasize that everyday foods “help us build strong bodies and give us energy”.More:5 ways to keep your heart healthy during the holidaysEncourage children to have a daily fitness routine, especially those with lots of pent-up energy spending time indoors during the winter months. With the flexibility of online learning, parents can customize an exercise program to their student’s individual needs and work PE into the school day.Students can do short 5-10 minute drills between lessons, like jump rope, or scale the stairs a few times. I have always loved the outdoors and my favorite exercise is a short afternoon hike in the woods near my house. Oregon offers so many ways for families to explore green spaces, trails, and forests. When children get fresh air out in nature it’s good for their physical and mental well-being.Financial:As 2020 comes to an end, consider these tax and investment tipsStaying in shape should be fun, not something kids “have to do”. Try a yoga session in the morning to give young brains and bodies a boost to start the day. Use painter’s tape in the garage for games like hopscotch or Simon Says.Create a dress-up relay where parents put a set of their clothes on one side of the room then kids run from one side to the other, putting dress-up clothes on top of their regular clothes, and dash back to the starting point.Play video sports games or check out home exercises on YouTube. Give children balls, skateboards, and other gifts that encourage physical activity. Kids appreciate gadgets and competition so consider getting them a pedometer to count steps and challenge others to meet fitness goals.Story continues below the gallery.Make exercise a family affair with a neighborhood stroll or bike ride to get everyone moving. Craft an indoor fitness trail resembling a circuit course for the whole family. Post trail signs at fitness stations around the house describing each activity- such as, “jumping jacks”, and “pushups”. Play tunes while children complete exercises at each station, rotating to the next location every time a song ends.More:Pandemic-related weight gain in children can be reversedStudies confirm proper nutrition and exercise not only improve overall health for young people but also provide success in the classroom.7 Researchers now believe if children are more physically active and eat healthier, they can be protected from severe impacts of COVID-19.8 Hopefully some of these tips will help children embrace healthy diet and fitness practices during the pandemic, Oregon’s winter weather, and throughout the year. While exercise and wholesome eating habits are admirable New Year’s resolutions, they’re also gifts parents can give their kids that will produce benefits for many years to come.Rebecca Chitkowski is an assistant principal at Willamette Connections Academy.

When combined with physical activity, your diet can help you reach and maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, and promote overall health and wellbeing.Creating and maintaining healthy eating habits doesn’t have to be hard. If you start by incorporating small changes into your daily habits, you can make a big impact on your eating pattern and create lasting, healthy eating habits. Try including at least six of the following eight goals into your diet by adding one new goal each week.Choose red, orange, and dark-green vegetables along with other vegetables for your meals. Add fruit to meals as part of main or side dishes or as dessert. The more colorful you make your plate, the more likely you are to get the vitamins, minerals, and fiber your body needs to be healthy.Switch from a refined-grain food to a whole-grain food. For example, choose whole-wheat bread instead of white bread. Read the ingredients list and choose products that list a whole-grain ingredients first. Look for things like: “whole wheat,” “brown rice,” “bulgur,” “buckwheat,” “oatmeal,” “rolled oats,” quinoa,” or “wild rice.”Both have the same amount of calcium and other essential nutrients as whole milk, but fewer calories and less saturated fat.Protein foods group includes not only meat, poultry, and seafood, but also dry beans or peas, eggs, nuts, and seeds. Select leaner cuts of ground beef (where the label says 90% lean or higher), turkey breast, or chicken breast.Use the Nutrition Facts label to choose lower sodium versions of foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals. Select canned foods labeled “low sodium,” “reduced sodium,” or “no salt added.”Drink water to cut back on unnecessary calories from sugary drinks. Soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks are a major source of added sugar and calories in American diets. To add flavor to your water, add a slice of lemon, lime, apple or fresh herbs like mint or basil.Seafood has protein, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids (heart-healthy fat). Adults should try to eat at least eight ounces a week of a variety of seafood. Children can eat smaller amounts of seafood. Seafood includes fish such as salmon, tuna, and trout and shellfish such as crab, mussels, and oysters.Eat fewer foods that contain solid fats. The major sources for Americans are cakes, cookies, and other desserts (often made with butter, margarine, or shortening); pizza; processed and fatty meats (e.g., sausages, hot dogs, bacon, ribs); and ice cream.To maintain your healthy eating habits, try the following tips.Making sudden, radical changes to eating habits such as eating nothing but cabbage soup, can lead to short-term weight loss but it won’t be successful in the long run.

The defense mechanism or immune system is strong enough to defend the body. Unfortunately due to lack of time or laziness, many people prefer to take the easy way out by eating fast foods that do nothing for you but make you fat and unhealthy.I’ve always found that studying dramatically improves when you limit the amount of simple sugars and caffeine while studying. While both of these compounds provide a temporary boost, they also tend to come with a corresponding crash which can totally cripple concentration.I like to suggest people try drinking green tea instead of coffee or energy drinks like Red Bull. You get a very little amount of caffeine, but with no crash and you find that it really helps stabilize energy levels during long study periods.“I wrote a post titled “Proper Hydration is essential for good health” on my It’s All About Nutrition blog which talks about the importance of staying hydrated at all times and especially during hot summer months. Proper hydration is even more important during periods of heavy physical activity and stressful periods such as exam time.With a MS behind me, I can say a good diet and sleep is most important to me. I’ve never been heavy into sugars, don’t like the sweetness, and perhaps that’s served me well. A healthy diet, I feel, is the most important of the two, because I generally get enough sleep. Eating properly, I’m a born Southerner, has been a problem. No, I’m not overweight, but it’s only because I try to live a healthy lifestyle. I think this is an situation that each of us, on our own, must figure out.Proper hydration and diet and very big factors. Also adequate exercise will help concentration. I’m not sure coffee is a good thing.I’ve been trying to follow an alkaline foods list for benefits of more mental clarity and energy. The first 10 days loosely following it worked well. I definitely felt less groggy when waking up which let me study more effectively. The simple breakfasts it provides are worthwhile too.I couldn’t agree more with this article. There is NO substitute for getting your vitamins and minerals from the food that you eat, so diet is the most important factor.However, it’s not always possible to eat a healthy well-balanced diet – especially if you’re revising. So that’s when supplements can help.As one poster has pointed out, there’s no mention of essential fatty acids (EFAs) here, and they are REALLY important for brain function.If you’d like to find out more about Omega 3 fish oils and how they could be of benefit to you, check out my web site.

Oatmeal quick oats is great for breakfast to… just microwave water for a few minutes pour on quick oats… add some honey or blue berries & your good to go in a few minutes! Dont forget to drink more water & get more sleep!!I think if you follow the food pyramid guidelines you would be alright with that.Acidity in the body causes the alkalizing minerals to be leached from the other parts of the body to neutralize the acid which can definitely affect brain and body function.

They will come right in handy, as I’m having my first exam next week. Eating good is not just for muscle-heads. All the same avoid heavy, starchy foods when studying or going for an exam as these can make you sluggish and/or sleepy.Healthy eating should not be done when there you are about to take an examination, but it should be done everyday to ensure that your brain is functioning properly as well as the rest of your body. When choosing the right food for you, you have to know what kind of food preparation is the cleanest – take kosher food as an example. There is a saying that “we are what we eat” and it would be great to be known as a healthy person instead of just going for the taste and ignoring the health implications.YES!! And the main thing is don’t give into fast food… its so hard to say now because its so easy & fast!!Great stuff. These exams can be tough if you don’t have the right energy. ThanksAny edge helps in test taking and if you’re feeling good from what you’ve eaten, that is only a plus. These are valuable tips not only during exams but it can used regularly. Soluble fiber foods are always preferred over insoluble fiber foods although both are rich in nutrients they have a difference. Soluble fiber foods once had even a little doesn’t make us hungry for a long time. I think a proper diet is required during the exams, correct?Thanks

227,https://lifesum.com/nutrition-explained/maintain-your-healthy-lifestyle-with-these-7-tips,"It's easy to falter at any point on a healthy lifestyle journey, but we can help. Check out these 7 tips to keep your healthy streak going. Whether you’ve already reached your target weight or you’re eagerly anticipating the moment that you do, understanding how to maintain a healthy status is essential. From staying on top of maintenance calories to knowing how to handle setbacks, use these seven tips to maintain your healthy lifestyle.Staying hydrated can help with weight maintenance.When it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, one of the most important things you can do is simply striving for consistency. No matter how busy life gets or how much your schedule changes on a daily basis, try to eat the same balance of whole foods, consume a similar number of calories, and work in a consistent amount of physical activity.You might be tempted to maintain your healthy habits during the week and give yourself a break on the weekend, but it’s important to keep things consistent every day of the week. By sticking to your healthy habits seven days a week, you’ll be less tempted to binge and more likely to sustain your weight loss for the long term.After reaching your weight loss goal, you might be tempted to ease up on your diet plan or change your eating patterns altogether. While it might be a good idea to incorporate a different range of nutritious foods in your diet, it’s important to keep an eye on your caloric intake. After all, the number of calories you need at your target weight probably won’t be the same as what you needed when you began your weight loss journey.To determine how many maintenance calories you need, calculate your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) regularly to ensure that you’re helping your body achieve the ideal energy balance. To do this, multiply your weight in pounds by 1.2 if you’re relatively sedentary, by 1.5 if you get moderate exercise, or by 1.75 if you’re training for a marathon. Then, use a Calories Per Day calculator app to track your caloric intake and make sure you’re getting what you need to maintain your current weight.You already know that regular exercise and good physical fitness is essential for helping you reach your ideal weight. But you might not realize how important exercise is for feeling good and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.If you’re already used to getting your cardio and strength training in during your daily visit to the gym, keep it up. If you’re ready for a change of your routine, however, try not to take a break. Instead, squeeze in at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day, whether you’re jogging on the treadmill, going for a swim, or going for a hike around your local park.When your primary goal is getting in shape and eating right, you might not give water the attention it deserves. As you strive to keep up your healthy habits, however, it’s important to increase your water consumption.Not only will drinking water keep you hydrated and improve how your body functions, but keeping the water flowing can also help with weight maintenance. Try drinking a large glass of water before a meal, and the feeling of fullness you’ll experience could help to reduce your calorie intake.Life has a habit of getting busy, but if you never make time for sleep, your healthy lifestyle goals could suffer. After all, sleep debt and weight gain are more closely connected than you might think. When you don’t get enough sleep, you’re more likely to skip the exercise that helps you burn fat and build muscle, and you’re prone to making unhealthy eating decisions. In fact, sleep deprivation encourages unhealthy decisions, as it reduces activity in the part of your brain that oversees impulse control.So how can you make sure that being tired doesn’t prompt you to make bad choices? Aim to get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night, and try to find the ideal amount of sleep for your body.After tracking your weight loss progress carefully for months or years, you might be looking forward to setting aside the scale or putting down the calorie tracking apps. Reaching your target weight doesn’t mean you should stop assessing your progress, though. Instead, it’s important to continue to track your progress so you can make sure you’re maintaining your healthy lifestyle.Use an app to continue to track your food intake and exercise routines, and make a point of hopping on the scale once a week. Since your new goal is maintaining your current weight, you’ll want to keep an eye out for weight gain or loss. When you use an app to keep a digital diary, you can easily look back on your patterns and identify unhealthy habits before they cause you to get too far off track.Even when you try your hardest to stick to your healthy habits, you have to expect the occasional setback. Whether you feel under the weather and have to skip your spin class or you accidentally overindulged at a birthday party, you’re bound to have a bad day every once in awhile.When this happens, don’t assume the worst or convince yourself that you’ve ruined your diet for good. Instead, do your best to power through the day, forgive yourself for a minor slip up, and get back to your healthy habits right away. Try drinking extra water, making sure that you get enough sleep, and restocking your fridge with healthy options. Understand that one off day won’t compromise all your hard work and that a small setback doesn’t have to derail everything you want to achieve.As you adopt these seven strategies and strive to keep your energy balance consistent, keep in mind that maintaining optimal health isn’t merely a short-term goal. Consider a healthy lifestyle to be the key for your long-term health, and set far-reaching goals that will help you stay healthy no matter what life may bring.All of the content and media on Lifesum is created and published for information purposes only.

It can be difficult to change old habits, but there are steps you can take to become healthier. An important first step is identifying less healthy habits and learning new, positive ones to replace them, such as:The key to developing positive habits that you are more likely to keep is to:Change just one thing at a time - see the benefits that can come from eating more wholesome food or, taking up exercise or, quitting smokingMake small changes – like going for a regular walk, instead of pushing yourself to run 5km every day, this will have more chance of becoming a habit you’ll keep.Be flexible – for example, if you decide to cut down on sugar, do it gradually over a few weeks rather than all at once. By cutting down from two teaspoons in your coffee to one-and-a-half, then one and so on, your taste buds will adapt and you’re less likely to crave for the sugar.Build on what you already do – for example, if you sometimes buy fruit to eat, then try buying more of this (and fewer biscuits and chips).Remember, increasing or adding even one new health behaviour can make a big difference to your health.There are things you can do to manage any extra challenges related to your illness and it’s treatment – such as drowsiness, sugar cravings or lack of motivation. Steps you can take include:Being healthy is about more than getting fit and feeling better, it’s about staying that way too. Tips to help you stay motivated include:There are lots of ways to get the support you need to help stay healthy. An important step is ﬁnding a good GP (general practitioner) you are comfortable discussing your health with. Seeing the same GP each time means you can work together to manage your health and organise check-ups as needed.Having someone else as a ‘support person’ can make all the difference in keeping up healthy habits. Talk with your friends, family, mental health program or case worker. Don’t forget other services in your area that you can draw on too.Feeling good, feeling healthyThe great thing about being healthy is that it helps you feel good as well as doing you good. It’s about what you eat and drink. It’s about sleeping well. It’s about being physically active, and enjoying yourself without risking your health.Being healthy is not about being skinny or building up your muscles in a gym, then, it’s about feeling fitter – physically, mentally and emotionally.‘Healthy living’ means making changes to your life to develop new habits that improve your health in all these ways.The more you know about the beneﬁts of healthy living, the easier it is to get motivated and start doing something about it. Here are some of the beneﬁts:Feeling better mentallyResearch shows that getting regular exercise can lift your mood and helps you feel better, reducing symptoms for people with depression.For people with psychotic illnesses, cutting out cannabis has been shown to reduce symptoms and makes it less likely a psychotic episode will recur. It may even mean that your doctor can look at reducing the dose of your antipsychotic medicationSaving moneyBuying junk food, smoking and drinking alcohol is expensive. Eating good, wholesome foods (starting with tasty vegetables and fruit) and cutting down on alcohol and smoking can make a real difference in spending, which means more money for the things you really enjoy (see ‘Rewarding Yourself’).Fewer health problemsA healthier lifestyle means being less at risk of developing illnesses, which start to affect us as we grow older.Weight gain is a common side-effect of some medications for Schizophrenia and related conditions, and this can be associated with a number of physical health problems. .Developing good habitsJust like bad habits, good habits are hard to shake. Once you become used to small changes in your lifestyle, you ﬁnd they become part of your daily routine. For example, many people say the more regularly they exercise, the more they enjoy it – really missing it when they have to skip a session.Taking control of your lifeDoing something about getting healthy helps you feel you are taking control of your life. This feels good . . .Healthy Living is not just about what you should be doing, it is also about recognising what you are doing now that’s good for you. Check out this list of easy healthy things, and see how many you are already doing:The first stepsA lot of what we do is driven by habit. Important ﬁrst steps in getting healthy are identifying negative habits and learning new, positive ones to replace them.For most people, there are certain times when negative habits are more likely to appear.When we’re boredWhen we’re bored it’s easy to fall into the trap of doing things that are bad for your health such as smoking and overeating. This is when it can be helpful to think about what positive things you can do with your time and energy.When we feel downWhen we’re feeling down, it’s tempting to turn to ‘quick ﬁxes’ such as drinking alcohol, smoking, eating and using illegal drugs.The bad news is that ‘quick ﬁxes’ don’t last long and leave you feeling worse than before. The good news is that there are other, better ways to make yourself feel good.When we feel tiredHaving a mental illness, and even taking medication, can make people feel tired a lot of the time. Sometimes even the thought of being physically active or cooking a good meal can seem impossible. But eating better, more wholesome food can give you some of the energy you have been lacking.And the same goes for exercise. Once you start to make it a new habit, you will start to feel you have more energy than before.When we feel stressed or anxiousEveryone feels stressed or anxious at times – but if these feelings persist, it’s important to deal with them sensibly.Over-eating, drinking alcohol, smoking or using illegal drugs can seem like easy ways of dealing with stress and anxiety. Unfortunately, they will only make things worse in the long run.Think about other things to help you relax which suit you – for example, listening to peaceful music, talking to someone, breathing exercises, Tai Chi or Yoga. If anxiety persists you should also talk it over with a health professional.AnniversariesIt can be tempting to deal with the anniversary of a sad event by doing something unhealthy, like binge-eating or getting drunk. Think about how you could break this habit by planning to do something completely different around that time – for example, by arranging to go away to visit someone or starting a new course or hobby.Choose your companyIt can be difﬁcult to change old habits if you’re hanging out with people who do the things you want to stop, like smoking for example. Think about ways of seeing these people that don’t involve being tempted into your old habits. If they smoke when having a coffee, for example, you might want to suggest going for a walk or to a movie instead of a café when you catch up.When you don’t feel good about yourselfWhen people feel down they sometimes can’t be bothered about looking after their health. Everyone likes to feel good, though, and once you start to enjoy the beneﬁt of changing just one habit – such as breathing easier after quitting cigarettes – then it becomes easier to change other things.Side-effects of medicationSome medications used to treat mental illness can have side-effects such as weight-gain and making people feel drowsy, restless or hungry. This can be a challenge to building up a healthy lifestyle but there are common-sense ways of dealing with it.For example, if you feel drowsy in the mornings, arrange to exercise in the afternoon. If you regularly crave sweet foods, keep fresh fruit or fruit snacks around the house instead of biscuits.The smoking habitOne of the most common harmful habits around is smoking, and people affected by mental illness are much more likely to be cigarette smokers than average.If you smoke, think about how you could make the first moves to quitting: talk to your doctor about aids such as nicotine replacement (and how this might interact with medications).For further information, please see the Guide to a Smokefree Life.For someone to talk to about ways to give up smoking, ring Quitline on 131 848.Here are some tips on developing positive habits to help your healthy, new lifestyle.Build on what you already doChances are that you already have some healthy habits – recognise and build on these. For example, try eating heatlhy foods and eating in moderation. Start slowlyRushing into things is not a good way to develop healthy new habits. Pace yourself by making small changes, which are more likely to be kept up. For example, it’s better to start exercising by going for a regular walk, than by suddenly pushing yourself to run 5 km every day.Vary techniquesDon’t allow a new habit to get boring – remember, variety is the spice of life. For example, if you go for a walk a few times a week, don’t feel you have to stick to exactly the same route. Go a different way through your local park, or explore a new route altogether.Be flexibleIt’s not always easy to change habits. Be ready for this by being flexible rather than too hard on yourself or just giving up. For example, if you stop taking sugar with coffee and ﬁnd you really miss the flavour – switch to using a low-calorie sweetener rather than going back to sugar.Look after your bodyRegular physical health checks by your doctor are an important part of looking after yourself.This is a good idea for everyone, and especially for people with a mental illness as some of those affected can be at greater risk of physical health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease. This can be due to the effects of weight gain combined with high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar (sometimes called ‘metabolic syndrome’).For this reason it is important to see a GP regularly and have periodic checks of weight, waist measurement and blood tests for cholesterol, blood sugar, and liver function among others. The doctor can also advise on a healthy lifestyle, including an improved diet, getting regular exercise, quitting smoking, and sleeping well, for example.Danny is 34. He was diagnosed with Schizophrenia in his early twenties and has been taking medication regularly for seven years. While his symptoms are under control, he has become unﬁt and overweight, gaining 20 kg.Danny was a good tennis player at high school, but stopped playing when he became unwell. He is still a fan of the sport and enjoys watching it on TV. Sometimes he thinks about how great it would be to play again, but then gets depressed about how out-of-shape he’s become.Danny is a good example of someone wants to become physically active, but doesn’t know how to start.This needs to be done in a realistic way which isn’t discouraging, and which he can keep up in the long term. By starting small he can build up his ﬁtness and conﬁdence so that playing tennis can become a reality. For example:Write down the main thing you’d like to do to get healthy yourself. It could be giving up smoking, sleeping more regularly, losing a bit of weight, or even just being more physically active.Then, write down some new healthy habits you could start to practise to achieve this.How to stay healthyBeing healthy is about more than getting ﬁt and feeling better, it’s about staying that way too.Here are some tips to help you stay motivated to be healthy.Think about why you want to be healthyThere will be times when you don’t feel like bothering, and are tempted to slip back into old, unhealthy habits. When this happens, think about why you wanted to be healthier in the ﬁrst place.Join a groupJoining a group where others are trying to reach the same goal can give you the extra push you may need to keep going. This might be a gym, a gardening club, a neighbourhood house or whatever suits you.Get supportHaving someone to support you can be a big help in getting started, and can make a real difference to keeping you on track too. Let a family member, friend or health worker know how you’re getting on and encourage them to support you.Look after your mental healthRemember to keep an eye on your mental as well as physical health. If you start to feel down and like not bothering, it could be a sign that your mental health needs some extra care, so make sure you tell your doctor or case manager about it.Relaxing matters tooRemember that relaxing and not getting stressed are essential parts of being healthy. There are lots of free and easy ways to stay relaxed, for example:Being healthy can change the way you feel about your whole life. The very point of it is to make you feel good, not to ‘punish your body’. That’s why making sure you reward yourself for developing healthier habits is important.When you’re spending less on cigarettes and other things that aren’t healthy, you can spend more on treating yourself. Here are some examples of rewards you can give yourself which are enjoyable and cost little or nothing:There are bound to be times when you feel like giving up and going back to old habits. It’s only natural. Try the following tips to deal with these times.Just start againWhen you do slip up – skipping a walk or having a cigarette, for example – don’t think you’ve failed. Look at how far you’ve come and what you want to achieve, and just start again.Be realisticMore than one slip-up could mean that you’re expecting too much of yourself. Think about how realistic you’re being about changing to more healthy habits, and that you do need to be flexible.For example, if replacing coffee with herbal tea isn’t working, switch to de-caff instead, or use a half or quarter teaspoon of coffee instead of a whole one.Don’t punish yourselfGetting healthy isn’t about feeling guilty. If you do have slip-ups, don’t waste time telling yourself that you’re hopeless. Guilt won’t help you get healthy. Concentrate instead on the progress you’ve already made, and on getting back into your new habit.Learn from your slip-upsBe positive about slip-ups – they can help you in the long run. Thinking about why they happened will help you learn to avoid them in future.For example, if you visit a friend in the evenings and they like to smoke cannabis at the end of the day, it can be hard to say no. A lesson from this could be to meet them in a café or in the afternoon when you won’t be tempted. Ask them not to offer you a smoke too – a true friend will respect this.After her second psychotic episode, Kelly recognised she needed to stop smoking cannabis because it made her symptoms worse. She went for over two months without a smoke, but one night – after an argument with her sister – she went to a friend’s place and had a couple of joints to unwind. The next day she felt really paranoid, and was disappointed with herself for going back to the dope.Kelly can learn from what happened – that she’s tempted to smoke when she gets stressed. Now that she knows this, she can do things to reduce the chance of it happening again, for instance:Write down some things you can think of to reward yourself for being healthy.Everyone needs support sometimesThere are lots of ways to get the support you need to help stay healthy. An important step is ﬁnding a good GP (general practitioner) you are comfortable discussing your health with.Having someone else as a ‘support person’ can be a big help, and don’t forget other services in your area that you can draw on too.It’s a good idea to have a regular doctor, a GP, who has an understanding of your general health and whom you are comfortable talking to. Seeing the same GP regularly means they can keep a better eye on your health and organise any check-ups needed.If you don’t have one yet, ask people you know if they can recommend one. You can also just go down to your local GP’s surgery and ask to be registered.Check it outWe all know the feeling of wondering if something is wrong – a bump, an ache, or something else – and doing nothing while we hope it goes away. Often, though, we end up worrying at the back of our minds anyway.If there is something that needs treatment, then it’s best for it to be checked out as soon as possible. This goes for your mental as well as physical health. That’s why if you are feeling unwell at all it’s best to see your GP. If nothing else, it means you can be reassured and stop worrying about it.Prevention is better than cureLots of health problems can be detected early or avoided if you get checked out regularly. This is especially important as we get a little older, or if at risk of the ‘metabolic syndrome’. Discuss with your GP having regular tests for things such as cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and breast or prostate cancer, for example.Take some notes alongIt’s difﬁcult to remember everything you need to tell a doctor. Sometimes we just forget, or are embarrassed, or don’t want to bother them. That’s why it’s a really good idea to scribble down some notes before seeing the doctor – just some dot points are enough, to remind you of everything you wanted to ask about.Be directLike anyone else, doctors understand something better when it’s explained in a simple, direct way. The more information you give, too, will help to make a diagnosis, so you get the right treatment.Be as speciﬁc as you can about what’s bothering you. For example, if there’s a chest pain, is it sharp or aching? Is it on the right, left or centre? Is it only present when you exercise or after meals? All this will help the doctor to help you.Be sure to tell the doctor, too, about any family history of medical conditions (such as diabetes or heart disease), and any medications you are taking, whether prescribed or not.When you are on to a good thingIt’s a good idea to see the same GP regularly. This means the doctor gets to know your medical history, and helps you feel more comfortable in talking about personal things. That way, when you have concerns about your health you are more likely to feel relaxed about seeing your GP, and they are more likely to be able to help.Having someone around to encourage you can make all the difference in learning new, healthy habits.This support person could be your case manager or other support worker from a day program or Personal Helper And Mentor (PHAM) program, for example. It could be a neighbour, friend, someone in your family, or even your psychiatrist or GP. It can be anyone who knows you’re trying to lead a healthier life and agrees to help and keep a friendly eye on how you’re getting on.The following things are important when thinking about who to ask to be your support person.TrustRemember your support person needs to be someone you trust, and who will take a real interest in how you are getting on.AvailabilityNo one can be available all the time, but think about how available a person is – in person, by phone or email.FamiliarityBeing a support person means being familiar with you and your life. This is likely to be someone you’ve known for some time and are comfortable talking to.A positive attitudeA good support person sees the bright side of life. It can make all the difference to have someone with a positive approach to life helping you – it’s surprisingly infectious.Here are some things to talk about with your support person, to help them help you to keep up your healthy new habits.Explain what you’re trying to doBe speciﬁc about what you want to do. For example, if you want to start getting ﬁtter, don’t let them think you’re necessarily going to join a gym and do weights, when what you have in mind is walking around a park once a day.Think about alternativesThere are bound to be days when you just don’t feel like doing things. Talk about this beforehand so that there’s an alternative. For example, you can agree that if you’re not motivated to get your usual exercise, the support person could come round and go on a shorter walk with you – to keep your healthy habit up.Being preparedIf there are things you know are going to be a problem or a challenge, talk to your support person about getting ready to deal with these. For example, if you tend to snack a lot in the afternoon, your support person could suggest rearranging the kitchen cupboard so that healthier foods such as dried fruit, pretzels, or rice crackers are at the front and the unhealthier, fatty foods are stored somewhere more difﬁcult to reach.Learning by exampleIf your support person leads a healthy life, then you can learn from their example or even do things together. For example, if they are a keen gardener, you could help them out or even learn how to grow your own vegetables – getting exercise, fresh air, and free, good food too.Having a back-up planThere are bound to be times when your support person is not around. Discuss a back-up plan with them for when this happens.For example, if you usually have a walk together, the support person might help you to arrange to walk someone’s dog while they’re away. People are often grateful to have a dog-walker, and it means you have a daily routine that gives you exercise too.As well as your GP and support person, don’t forget to check out other services that will help you get healthier.Council recreation centresThese often offer cheap or free facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts and skating ramps.Local gymnasiumsGyms can have a range of facilities such as swimming pools and exercise machines as well as groups such as aerobics and Tai Chi. Some offer lower fees for people with Pension or Health Care Cards.Local Community Health CentresThese often have general health services such as dentists, podiatrists, psychologists and access to immunisation.Neighbourhood housesNeighbourhood houses often run groups that can help you with healthy living including Tai Chi, meditation, Yoga, dance or walking groups. Some also have groups such as weight loss programs, Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous.Local marketsGet to know your local market – not only because the food is fresh, varied and cheap (especially just before closing), but also because it’s an enjoyable and friendly way to shop and meet people. If near enough, walk there with a shopping trolley, so you get some exercise and fresh air too.Lyndall is in her forties and was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 13 years ago. She’s been getting stomach pains over the past month, but her GP has told her to ‘keep taking her antipsychotic medication and she’ll be ﬁne’.She feels the doctor sees her as a ‘psych patient’ only and doesn’t take her physical health seriously.Lyndall also wants to get ﬁtter so she’s not out-of-breath all the time, but can’t get motivated to start exercising.Don’t be afraid to ask for more support when you need it. It’s important for Lyndall to have a GP she is comfortable with, and who looks after her physical as well as mental health. She also needs someone to support her in getting motivated to exercise. Steps she can take include:Write down some ways in which you could get support for your healthy new habits.If you or someone you know experiences a mental health crisis and becomes highly distressed, it can be difficult for others to know what to do.

231,https://foodinsight.org/healthy-eating-on-campus-101/,"By Food InsightSeptember 12, 2017Imagine that the minivan is packed with fresh twin XL sheets and too many plastic drawers and bins to bother counting. You get to campus to unload and before you know it, your teary-eyed family drives away leaving you on your own. With this moment comes a new-found independence and the responsibility of making your own decisions for the first time- including decisions about what to eat!Dining on campus often involves buffet style dining with a wide variety of foods. Limited time, money, space, and cooking equipment also means you may have to adapt your normal routine to eat healthy on campus.  Below are tips and tricks that can help you navigate your way through the campus dining environment and create your own balanced meals to keep yourself healthy!1. Get to know your options. When eating a la carte or buffet style in the dining hall, you may be faced with more options than you’re used to. Check out your school webpage or ask the campus dining staff where you can find the nutrition information of the foods served. Many campuses even offer students services from registered dietitians!2. Tune in to your hunger cues. When you are busy, it can be tough to always remember to stop and eat. But remember that skipping meals may cause you to eat more than you need later. Establish a meal-time routine around your classes and extracurricular activities. Also, get to know your hunger and fullness cues with mindful eating.3. Make your plate look like MyPlate. Aim to have three square meals per day using your meal plan. When selecting your food items, picture the MyPlate visual to help you create a well-rounded meal with proper serving sizes. 4. Save any extra servings or items rather than over eating. Instead of forcing down the second half of your grilled chicken wrap, or worse: throwing it away, take it home and save it for later.  You can ask the dining staff for a to-go box or you can bring your own reusable container with you. Most dorm rooms are equipped with mini fridges and microwaves that will make eating your leftovers easy, and you will be happy to have them later. This is a healthy way to reduce wasted food… and money!5. Take a break from school work and television while eating. Studies have shown that eating while distracted by other activities such as working is linked to over eating. Put a pause on the work and television while you eat and use your meal time as an opportunity to socialize with friends or reflect on your day. And, it’s always a great idea to practice mindful and intuitive eating by bringing full awareness to the when, why, and how much of each meal that you eat! 6. Stock up on staple foods for your dorm room. Having healthy food options around your dorm room can help ensure you always have access to a healthy snack or meal when you don’t have time to make it to the dining hall. A mini fridge should be able to fit a few small items such as mini bottles of milk, Greek yogurt, fresh fruits and veggies, and even hummus. In the room you can keep wholesome cereal choices, oatmeal, nuts and seeds, dried fruit, sweet potatoes, and more. You can even try and use your extra meal plan money to purchase the food staples when you need to stock up.7. Add protein to every meal. Ensuring that protein is a part of every meal will help to keep you full for a longer period. Easy ways to add protein to your breakfast are through eggs, Greek yogurt, nut butter, turkey sausage, and milk. Ideas to add protein to your lunch and dinner are through low-sodium lunch meat, lean chicken and pork, fish, hard boiled eggs, nuts and seeds, quinoa, tofu, and beans.8. Get your five a day. Fruits and vegetables are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. You can mix it up and keep your meals interesting by choosing from a variety of fresh, frozen, and canned options. Whenever possible, grab an extra piece of fruit on your way out of the dining hall, drop some blueberries in your cereal, toss some veggies in your omelet or stir fry, and layer some lettuce and tomato onto your sandwich. You get the idea- add them when you can!9. Take advantage of the salad bar. Salad bars are a quick and painless way to get a heaping plate of fresh fruits and vegetables all at once. Try to make a salad with lots of different colored veggies- picture the rainbow, and stick only one or two extra toppings. For an added bonus, a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar is a delicious and healthy option for any salad!This post was written by Alison Webster, dietetic intern at Virginia Tech. © 2021 International Food Information Council.

When children are young, parents and other caregivers are responsible for providing an environment that helps them maintain a lifestyle that is beneficial to their health. You can help your child by doing the following:When it comes to nutrition and fitness, the role of parents is the same no matter the size of their children. A healthy weight for kids is about much more than numbers. It is about healthy behaviors, such as enjoying a variety of foods and activities for strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity.Diets can do more harm than good. Research suggests kids who diet end up weighing more than non-dieters, with lower self-esteem and greater risk for eating disorders. Do not put your child on a diet, especially without consulting your doctor and a registered dietitian nutritionist.Here are some simple actions adults can take to help children develop positive lifestyle habits. These strategies have been shown to promote a healthy weight for adults, too

233,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322268,"A healthful diet typically includes nutrient-dense foods from all major food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthful fats, and fruits and vegetables of many colors.Healthful eating also means replacing foods that contain trans fats, added salt, and sugar with more nutritious options.Following a healthful diet has many health benefits, including building strong bones, protecting the heart, preventing disease, and boosting mood.This article looks at the top 10 benefits of a healthful diet, and the evidence behind them.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the United States.The American Heart Association (AHA) state that almost half of U.S. adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a growing concern in the U.S. The condition can lead to heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. Some sources report that it is possible to prevent up to 80% of premature heart disease and stroke diagnoses with lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and healthful eating.The foods people eat can reduce their blood pressure and help keep their heart healthy. The dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet, known as the DASH diet, includes plenty of healthful foods for the heart. The program recommends the following:High fiber foods are also crucial for keeping the heart healthy. The AHA state that dietary fiber helps improve blood cholesterol and lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The medical community has long recognized the link between trans fats and heart-related illnesses, such as coronary heart disease.Limiting certain types of fats can also improve heart health. For instance, eliminating trans fats reduces the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This type of cholesterol causes plaque to collect within the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke.Reducing blood pressure can also promote heart health. A person can achieve this by limiting their salt intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams per day.Food manufacturers add salt to many processed and fast foods, and a person who wishes to lower their blood pressure should avoid these products.Learn more about the DASH diet here.Eating foods that contain antioxidants can reduce a person’s risk of developing cancer by protecting cells from damage.The presence of free radicals in the body increases the risk of cancer, but antioxidants help remove them to lower the likelihood of this disease.Many phytochemicals found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes act as antioxidants, including beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E.According to the National Cancer Institute, though humans trials are inconclusive, there are laboratory and animal studies that link certain antioxidants to a reduced incidence of free radical damage due to cancer.Foods high in antioxidants include:Having obesity may increase a person’s risk of developing cancer and result in poorer outcomes. Maintaining a moderate weight may reduce these risks.In a 2014 study, researchers found that a diet rich in fruits reduced the risk of upper gastrointestinal tract cancers. They also found that a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and fiber lowered the risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet rich in fiber reduces the risk of liver cancer.Read more about cancer-fighting foods here.Some evidence suggests a close relationship between diet and mood.In 2016, researchers found that diets with a high glycemic load may trigger increased symptoms of depression and fatigue.A diet with a high glycemic load includes many refined carbohydrates, such as those found in soft drinks, cakes, white bread, and biscuits. Vegetables, whole fruit, and whole grains have a lower glycemic load.If a person suspects they have symptoms of depression, talking to a doctor or mental health professional can help.The colon is full of naturally occurring bacteria, which play important roles in metabolism and digestion.Certain strains of bacteria also produce vitamins K and B, which benefit the colon. These strains also help fight harmful bacteria and viruses.A diet low in fiber and high in sugar and fat alters the gut microbiome, increasing inflammation in the area.However, a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains provides a combination of prebiotics and probiotics that help good bacteria thrive in the colon.These fermented foods are rich in probiotics:Fiber is an easily accessible prebiotic and is abundant in legumes, grains, fruits, and vegetables. It also promotes regular bowel movements, which can help prevent bowel cancer and diverticulitis.A healthful diet may help maintain cognition and brain health.A 2015 study identified nutrients and foods that protect against cognitive decline and dementia. The researchers found the following to be beneficial:Among other diets, the Mediterranean diet incorporates many of these nutrients.Read more about foods to boost brain function here.Maintaining a moderate weight can help reduce the risk of chronic health issues. Having overweight or obesity are risk factors for several conditions, including:Many healthful foods, including vegetables, fruits, and beans, are lower in calories than most processed foods. A person can determine their calorie requirements using guidance from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020.Maintaining a healthful diet free from processed foods can help a person stay within their daily limit without monitoring calorie intake.Dietary fiber is particularly important for managing weight. Plant-based foods contain plenty of dietary fiber, which helps regulate hunger by making people feel fuller for longer.In 2018, researchers found that a diet rich in fiber and lean proteins resulted in weight loss without the need for monitoring calorie intake.A healthful diet can help a person with diabetes in:It is vital for people with diabetes to limit their intake of foods with added sugar and salt. They should also consider avoiding fried foods high in saturated and trans fats.Read about the best foods for diabetes here.A diet with adequate calcium and magnesium is important for strong bones and teeth. Keeping the bones healthy can minimize the risk of bone issues later in life, such as osteoporosis.The following foods are rich in calcium:Food manufacturers often fortify cereals and plant-based milks with calcium.Magnesium is abundant in many foods, and some of the best sources include leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.A variety of factors, including sleep apnea, can disrupt sleep patterns.Sleep apnea occurs when the airways repeatedly become blocked during sleep. Risk factors include obesity, drinking alcohol, and eating an unhealthful diet.Reducing alcohol and caffeine intake can help a person gain restful sleep, whether they have sleep apnea or not.Children learn most health-related behaviors from the adults around them, and parents who model healthful eating and exercise habits tend to pass these on.Eating at home may also help. In 2018, researchers found that children who regularly ate meals with their families consumed more vegetables and fewer sugary foods than their peers who ate at home less frequently.In addition, children who participate in gardening and cooking at home may be more likely to make healthful dietary and lifestyle choices.There are plenty of small, positive ways to improve diet, including:A person may also benefit from taking a cooking class, and learning how to incorporate more vegetables into meals.Healthful eating has many health benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. It can also boost a person’s mood and provide them with more energy. A doctor or dietitian can provide tips on eating a more healthful diet.

					By: Christopher NeigerPop quiz, hot shot: Where can you find excessive loans, crazy professors, all-night studying and cumulative weight gain? College! And you thought it was an investment in your future...So maybe we're being a little too harsh on higher education, but that last part about weight gain is no joke. About 25-percent of college students gain at least 5 pounds in the first two months of stepping on campus, which adds a whole new definition to the term bell-shaped curve [source: Jampolis]. And we don't even have to mention (but we will) that the infamous ""Freshman 15"" can turn into even more, if you're not careful.AdvertisementWith bottomless ice-cream dispensers and endless greasy pizza, college is like a dream come true for nine-year-old you but it's a serious uphill battle if you're trying to stay healthy. But unlike getting that ""A"" in biology, it's not statistically impossible to stay healthy while living in your dorm. Take a look at our tips for keeping (or starting) that healthy dorm lifestyle. Thirty-five year old you will thank you later.The college life doesn't lend itself to traditional meal times, proper portions or basically anything that will benefit a healthy eating lifestyle. Classes can be held at breakfast, lunch and dinner times, which means snacking in between is highly probable. So if you can't avoid eating a few snacks before you head off to class, then choose snacks that will actually help fill you up and keep you healthy at the same time.Instead of snacking on things like cookies or potato chips try replacing them with some baby carrots or non-fat yogurt. Nutrition Specialist, Dr. Melina Jampolis, recommends college students snack on apples, string cheese, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or even mini cans of tuna as alternatives to unhealthy choices. The idea isn't to give up having a quick snack option, because that's probably not realistic, but to replace the bad choice with something much better for you [source: Jampolis].AdvertisementSome people suggest applying the 35/10/35 rule to your snack habits. This means your snack should be comprised of less than 35-percent fat, 10-percent saturated fat and less than 35-percent sugar per 100 calories. You can apply the same rule to picking your classes: An instructor should require reading less than 35-pages of each book assigned, the final should only be about 10-percent of your grade and there should be a 35-point curve added to every exam. But maybe that's just wishful thinking.Most cramped dorm room spaces don't lend themselves well to gym equipment. Heck, most of them don't even lend themselves well to chairs. But even in tight spaces there are exercises you can do in the dorm to stay in shape.A few free weights or a resistance band won't take up too much valuable space, but can give you a good workout. If you ride your bike around campus, you're obviously getting a good workout from that, but you can also hook that bike up to an indoor bike trainer. With the back wheel off the ground you can get in a great cardio workout without ever leaving the (ahem) comfort of your dorm room.AdvertisementIf you don't have weights or a bike, you can also kick-it old-school and break out some pushups, sit-ups, crunches and lunges. There are lots of YouTube videos that give step-by-step instructions for exercising in the dorm. Just be sure to follow workout instructions carefully, because doing an exercise the wrong way can actually do more harm than good.The important part is to add some physical activity to your daily routine. Sure, you're walking to class but you're also sitting down a lot and possibly eating a lot of unhealthy food. Integrate a 20 to 30 minute workout in addition to your other healthy choices.No, we're not kidding. We're going to make the assumption here that most college students reading this article drink alcohol. We know, we know...we're stereotyping. While we're at it, we're going to assume that said college students are also drinking more than a healthy amount. So first off, knock off the underage drinking. Totally not cool. Second, all that beer you're downing isn't doing anything good for your health.According to the Mayo Clinic, one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men is a healthy amount. One drink -- meaning 12 ounces of beer or 5 ounces of wine. At those recommended amounts you can reduce the risk of heart disease and heart attacks, lower the risk of gallstones and possible reduce the risk of strokes and diabetes. But when you consume more than that you take away all the health benefits and add a lot of drawbacks.AdvertisementSwiss researchers have found that drinking too much alcohol causes the body to burn fat much more slowly. Instead of burning off the fat your body wants to get rid of, it stores it in the paunch, thighs and other parts of the body. So, not only are you consuming additional calories, but your body is having a harder time getting rid of the fat as well [source: The New York Times].One obvious way to cut back is to keep the alcohol out of your dorm room. Your school may already keep a close eye on this anyway, but keeping it far away will make it easier for you not to over indulge. Aside from that, consider how much you're drinking and know that drinking too much is going to wreak havoc on your new healthy lifestyle.Dorm rooms aren't always the best places to get a little shuteye. Between loud roommates, late-night study sessions and countless opportunities to just get out, it can be hard to find time to sleep. According to Harvard Medical School's Division of Sleep Medicine, college students are one of the most sleep-deprived segments of the population. Only 11-percent of college students report that they sleep well consistently [source: Harvard].But college kids can handle it, right? It doesn't impact their young minds and bodies, right? You know where this is going. Those all-nighters you're pulling in order to get some extra studying in may be doing more harm than good. Studies show that sleeping directly after hearing a lesson is the best way to retain the information you've just heard. So make sure you fall asleep in the classroom directly after listening to a lecture. Well, maybe you shouldn't do that, but do sleep. Not only will you improve your mental capability, but it could keep you healthier as well.AdvertisementLack of sleep produces chemicals and hormones that can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Getting regular sleep may not make you healthier by itself, but it will give you more mental alertness and keep your body from developing harmful chemicals that could negatively impact your health in the future.So if your dorm is a little (or a lot) too loud, try some noise cancelling headphones or earplugs to drown out the sound. If that doesn't work, then get out and find a quiet place where you can get the rest you need. And yes, the basement of the library might be an option.I know what you're thinking, but yes, you can cook in your dorm. All you need is the Swiss Army Knife of dorm room essentials: The George Foreman Grill. Nothing may be easier than operating a George Foreman Grill. Seriously, walking is probably harder. George Foreman has sold over 100 million of the grills -- and for good reason. They're easier to operate than an elevator and they can help you stay healthy, too.Sure, you can still cook bad stuff in your dorm if you want, but having the option to cook your own food, as opposed to eating out or going to the dining hall, gives you a much healthier option. If your dorm offers a communal kitchen then use it. Making even a few meals yourself could drastically increase your healthy eating options.AdvertisementIf you don't have access to a communal kitchen and the George Foreman Grill is out of the question, then your last option is the microwave. There are plenty of cookbooks out there specifically for microwave chefs, and some of the recipes are much healthier than your on-campus options. Just be sure that none of your microwave recipes start with the word ""Hot"" and end in ""Pockets.""I wish I had read (or written) something like this while I was in college. I probably could have kick-started some healthy habits back then that would still be paying off now. Hindsight, I suppose. I ate out constantly and then hit the dining hall when I ran out of money. Come to think of it, I could have increased my health and my bank account at the same time if I ate out less in college! Maybe I should read the HowStuffWorks article on How Time Travel Works?Even though this article was about healthy living in the dorms, it really follows the ideas of healthy living in general. Exercise, eat right and get plenty of sleep. That basically sums it up. It's the whole doing it part that makes it so difficult.Please copy/paste the following text to properly cite this HowStuffWorks.com article:Explore More HowStuffWorks:AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementLearn How Everything Works!CompanyInformationExploreCopyright © 2021 HowStuffWorks, a division of InfoSpace Holdings, LLC, a System1 CompanyPrivacy ChoicesWe use cookies to personalise content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic.

Nick FerrariIf your favorite vegetable isn't in season, grab a frozen bag of it for the same nutritional value.The editors at AARP have filtered through numerous medical journals and studies to identify the best actions you can take to achieve a longer, fuller life. We know there are no guarantees. But genetics account for just 25 percent of a person’s longevity. The rest is up to you. With this collection of some of the most important longevity findings, you’ll have the road map you need to get to 80, 90, 100 or beyond.AARP Membership: Join or Renew for Just $16 a Year1. Frozen is fineYou can eat a balanced diet even when fresh fruits and vegetables are out of season because frozen can be as good as or even better for life-extending nutrients. British scientists found that fresh fruit can lose nutrients after three days of refrigeration, while frozen fruits don’t suffer the same fate. Another study similarly found that frozen blueberries contained more vitamin C than fresh ones. 2. Cut back on pain pillsRegular use of painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen — including over-the-counter brands such as Advil, Motrin and Aleve — may raise your risk of heart attack and stroke by 10 percent, according to a 2014 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel review. (Prescription-strength versions may increase your risk by 20 to 50 percent, even after just a few weeks of use.) Reserve these drugs for severe pain, and use the lowest possible dose for the shortest amount of time. 3. Please go to bedConsistently sleeping less than six hours a night nearly doubles your risk of heart attack and stroke, according to a review of 15 studies published in the European Heart Journal. Another study found that consistently sleep-deprived people were 12 percent more likely to die over the 25-year study period than those who got six to eight hours of sleep a night. These tips from the National Sleep Foundation can help ensure that you get good quality shut-eye, even if you’re among the half of people over 60 who have insomnia: 4. But don’t always go right to sleepA Duke University study that followed 252 people for 25 years concluded that frequent sex “was a significant predictor of longevity” for men.IstockMarriage is good for the heart in more ways than one. 5. Get (or stay) hitchedMarriage truly is good for your health — and your longevity. The prestigious Framingham Offspring Study found that married men had a 46 percent lower risk of death than never-married men, in part due to marriage’s well-known impact on heart health. Indeed, a 2014 study by New York University’s Langone Medical Center found that married men and women had a 5 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease.6. Ripeness mattersNo, you won’t die from eating under-ripe produce, but new research shows that fully ripened fruit has more life-lengthening health benefits. For example, green bananas are low in fiber and high in astringent tannins that can cause constipation. Fully ripened pears and blackberries have more disease-fighting antioxidants. And in watermelon, a deep red color signifies more lycopene, an antioxidant that may reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease.7. Don’t sweeten with sugarA high-sugar diet boosts blood sugar, which in turn plays havoc with your heart by increasing levels of LDL cholesterol while lowering heart-friendly HDL cholesterol, and tripling your risk for fatal cardiovascular disease. The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) of added sugar a day, and men no more than 9 teaspoons (36 grams).8. Consider extra vitamin DVitamin D, a bright byproduct of sunlight, has many health benefits, including a link to longevity. But too much vitamin D increases your risk of dying as much as too little, according to a 2015 Danish study. So you want to get the right amount. Don’t just rely on outdoor time to get extra vitamin D; the rate of skin cancer rises as we age, so it’s important to limit exposure. The smart plan: Ask your doctor if you would benefit from extra D in pill form. University of Copenhagen researchers found that the ideal vitamin D level is more than 50 nanomoles per liter of blood, but less than 100 nmol/L.9. Go greenIf coffee’s not your thing, green tea also has proven longevity cred, likely because it contains powerful antioxidants known as catechins that may help combat diabetes and heart disease. In a large study of more than 40,000 Japanese men and women, drinking five or more cups of green tea a day was associated with a 12 percent decrease in mortality among men and a 23 percent decrease among women. Getty ImagesTaking a break from work and going on a vacation is crucial to your well being. 10. Vacation … or ElseNot taking time off work might, indeed, be deadly. One study of men at high risk for coronary artery disease found that those who failed to take annual vacations were 32 percent more likely to die of a heart attack. And in the long-running Framingham Heart Study, women who vacationed just once every six years were eight times more likely to develop coronary artery disease or have a heart attack than women who vacationed twice a year.11. Eat whole grainsThe average American eats one serving of whole grains daily — and that may be just a single morning slice of toast. But eating three or more servings each day can cut overall death rate by about 20 percent, according to a 2016 study from Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Have some oatmeal or brown rice, or get adventurous and go for quinoa, barley, even farro.12. Spice it upEating hot chili peppers may add years to your life. In a 2016 analysis of the dietary habits of more than 16,000 men and women over 23 years, those who reported eating hot peppers reduced their risk of dying by 13 percent. Not a fan of those peppers? Even a little spice can have health benefits. That’s because the body produces endorphins to reduce the heat from the capsaicin in the peppers; those endorphins also reduce pain and inflammation.13. Drink whole milkYou’ve been told forever to drink low-fat or skim milk, or go for fat-free yogurt. But research published in the journal Circulation in 2016 concluded that those who consumed the most dairy fat had a 50 percent lower risk of developing diabetes, a disease that can shorten your life by eight to 10 years on average.14. Just add waterStaying adequately hydrated — measured by urine that’s light yellow or straw colored — can also help prolong a healthy life by reducing the risk of bladder and colon cancer and keeping kidneys in tip-top shape. Bonus: It might even help you lose weight. Researchers at the University of Illinois found that those who sipped more H2O ended up eating 68 to 205 fewer calories per day. Learn about health discoveries, explore brain games and read great articles in the 'Your Health' NewsletterNick FerrariA few cups of java a day might keep the doctor away. 15. Say yes to that extra cupCoffee does more than help you wake up; it also reduces your risk of stroke, diabetes and some cancers. And in a 2015 study published in the journal Circulation, Harvard researchers discovered that “people who drank three to five cups of coffee per day had about a 15 percent lower [risk of premature] mortality compared to people who didn’t drink coffee,” says coauthor Walter Willett, M.D. Mind you, a cup is 8 ounces, so your 16-ounce Starbucks grande is really two cups by that measure.16. Live like the AmishA University of Maryland study found that Amish men live longer than typical Caucasian men in the United States, and both Amish men and women have lower rates of hospitalization. What are the Amish ways? Lots of physical activity, less smoking and drinking, and a supportive social structure involving family and community. 17. End the day's eating by 9 p.m. Not only is eating late bad for your waistline — sleeping doesn’t exactly burn lots of calories — it also increases the risk of heart disease by 55 percent for men ages 45 to 82, according to a Harvard study. 18. Eat your veggiesIn a study of 73,000 adults, most in their mid to upper 50s, vegetarians were 12 percent less likely than carnivores to have died from any cause during the six-year study period. The 2016 study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that mortality rates were lowest overall for pesco-vegetarians (those who eat fish occasionally), followed by vegans (those who eat no animal products), and lacto-ovo vegetarians (those who eat dairy and eggs).19. Eat like the GreeksThe Mediterranean diet, with its reliance on fruits, vegetables, olive oil, fish and nuts, is one of the healthiest diets for both overall health and longevity. Harvard researchers, reporting in the BMJ in 2014, found that those who followed the diet most closely had longer telomeres, which cap the end of each strand of DNA and protect chromosomes from damage. Even those who only sporadically followed the diet reaped longevity benefits, researchers found.Nick FerrariCutting your portions helps you cut calories, which aids in weight loss and more.20. Eat lessIf you want to reach 100, put down the fork, says Dan Buettner, who studies longevity hot spots around the world, such as Okinawa, Japan. Buettner found that the oldest Okinawans stop eating when they feel 80 percent full. A National Institutes of Health-funded study similarly found that cutting back calories reduced blood pressure, cholesterol and insulin resistance.21. Drink less (here’s a trick) More-than-moderate alcohol consumption (generally, more than one drink a day for women or more than two a day for men) leads to a shorter life span. Here’s one way to cut your intake: Pour red wine into a white-wine glass, which is narrower. Studies by Cornell University’s Food and Brand Lab found that people poured 12 percent more into red-wine glasses. You’ll also pour less wine into your glass if it’s sitting on the table, instead of in your hand, says Brian Wansink, the lab’s director. 22. Save your penniesMoney might not make you happier, but it will help you live longer. A 2016 study by Stanford researchers published in JAMA found that people whose income bracket was in the top 1 percent lived nearly 15 years longer than those in the bottom 1 percent. The disparity could be attributed to healthier behaviors in higher-income groups, including less smoking and lower obesity rates, researchers say.23. Or move to one of these statesIf you’re not wealthy, consider moving to California, New York or Vermont, where studies show that low-income people tend to live the longest. Loma Linda, Calif., has the highest longevity thanks to vegetarian Seventh-day Adventists, who live eight to 10 years longer than the rest of us. Nevada, Indiana and Oklahoma have the lowest life expectancy (less than 78 years).24. Ponder a PonderosaExperiencing a sense of awe — such as when viewing the Grand Canyon or listening to Beethoven’s Ninth — may boost the body’s defense system, says research from the University of California, Berkeley. “That awe, wonder and beauty promote healthier levels of cytokines suggests that the things we do to experience these emotions — a walk in nature, losing oneself in music, beholding art — has a direct influence upon health and life expectancy,” says Dacher Keltner, a psychologist and coauthor of the study.Getty ImagesOwning a dog can help lower stress and boost physical activity. 25. Get a friend with four legsA few studies on the link between pet ownership and health have found that owning a pet can reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, even improve the odds of surviving a heart attack. Now the American Heart Association has weighed in with a report published in the journal Circulation that recommends owning a dog, in particular, for those seeking to reduce their risk of deadly heart disease. Dog owners are more likely to be physically active and are also less vulnerable to the effects of stress, the report says. 26. Find your purposeDo you wake up looking forward to something? In a 2014 study published in the Lancet, researchers found that those with the highest sense of purpose were 30 percent less likely to die during the 8.5-year study period. In fact, doing something that matters — whether it’s helping your children or interacting in a community of like-minded folks — is correlated with seven extra years of life, according to researchers who study people in “blue zones,” areas of the world where folks live the longest. 27. Embrace your faithAttending religious services once a week has been shown to add between four and 14 years to life expectancy, according to researchers who study blue zones. Don’t belong to a church? Ask to join a friend at her services, or just drop in at a nearby house of worship; most have an open-door policy.28. Be food safeAbout 3,000 Americans die from food poisoning annually, say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even seemingly healthy foods — like sprouts, cantaloupe, berries and raw tuna — can make you sick or even kill you, says the FDA. Your action plan: Keep your kitchen pristine, wash your hands and utensils before and after handling food, separate raw and cooked foods, refrigerate perishable food promptly, and cook food to a safe temperature to kill deadly bacteria. 29. Consider mountain lifePeople residing at higher altitudes tend to live longer, a study by the University of Colorado and the Harvard School of Global Health revealed. Of the 20 healthiest counties in America, many are in Colorado and Utah. Researchers think lower oxygen levels might cause your body to adapt in ways that strengthen your heart and circulation.Nick FerrariEating a handful of nuts five times per week can lower your mortality risk from certain diseases. 30. Go nutsIn a European study of adults ages 55 to 69, those who ate 10 grams of nuts daily — 8 almonds or 6 cashews — reduced their risk of death from any health-related cause by 23 percent. As for specific ailments, consuming a handful of nuts at least five times per week lowers the mortality risk for heart disease (by 29 percent), respiratory disease (24 percent) and cancer (11 percent), according to a previous U.S. study. Sorry, peanut butter fans: Spreads didn’t show the same benefits.31. Keep watching LOL cat videosLaughter really is the best medicine, helping to reduce stress, boost the immune system, reduce pain and improve blood flow to the brain. In fact, laughter has the same effect on blood vessels as exercise, report researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. 32. Get socialStudies show that loneliness increases the risk of early death by 45 percent. It weakens the immune system and raises blood pressure while increasing the risk for heart attacks and stroke. By contrast, people with strong ties to friends and family have as much as a 50 percent lower risk of dying, according to a study in PLOS Medicine. So visit a friend. And don’t discount your online friends. A 2016 study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego found that those who use Facebook also live longer, but only when online interactions don’t completely supplant face-to-face social interaction.33. Watch your grandkidsWhile babysitting every day is stressful, regularly watching the grands can lower your risk of dying by a third, according to a 2016 study published in Evolution and Human Behavior. That adds up to an extra five years of life, researchers say. They speculate that caregiving gives grandparents a sense of purpose, and keeps them mentally and physically active. 34. Try to stay out of the hospitalA 2016 Johns Hopkins University study found that some 250,000 patients die each year in hospitals from medical mistakes, such as misdiagnoses, poor practices and conditions, and drug errors. Sometimes the best way to avoid a grave condition is not to enter the system at all. How does your brain score? Find out at Staying SharpNick FerrariReading gives muscle to your memory.35. Read moreSounds like we made it up, but scientific research supports the longevity benefits of reading — newspapers and magazines will do, but books are the best. “As little as a half-hour a day of book reading had a significant survival advantage over those who did not read,” said the study’s senior author, Becca R. Levy, a professor of epidemiology at Yale.36. Read the ‘AARP Bulletin’Really. This and other smart publications can keep you up to date on health info. Studies have shown that when people are empowered with information to make important medical decisions, it not only enhances their well-being but also improves a treatment’s effectiveness. So keep reading aarp.org/bulletin and aarp.org/health.37. Monitor yourselfDon’t wait for annual checkups to consider your health. By then, a small problem could have morphed into a life-threatening illness. In one English study, researchers found that less than 60 percent of people who developed unusual symptoms in the previous three months had seen a doctor. Symptoms that might point to cancer include: unexplained weight loss of 10 pounds or more (this can be an indication of cancers of the esophagus, stomach or lungs); fever; extreme fatigue; changes in bowel or bladder habits; or unusual bleeding. Other unusual symptoms that could signal disease? A patch of rough, dark skin could indicate diabetes, and a strange color on your tongue could signal serious acid-reflux issues.38. Visit the hardware storeAmong the most common causes of “unintentional deaths” are carbon monoxide, radon and lead poisoning, the CDC reports. Make sure there’s a carbon monoxide detector near every bedroom, and be sure to test and replace the batteries every two years. Was your home built before 1978, when lead paint was outlawed? One trip to the store can get you all you need to test for these toxic substances.39. Practice home fire drillsJust 1 in 3 families have a fire-safety plan, says Robert Cole, president of Community Health Strategies, an injury-prevention education organization based in Pittsford, N.Y. “People underestimate the speed of a fire. Many waste time figuring out what to do, or trying to take belongings with them. Everyone should know what to do and how to get out safely.”IstockStudies show that female doctors are more effective communicators than male physicians. 40. Find a woman doctorWhen Harvard researchers in 2016 analyzed Medicare records documenting more than 1.5 million hospitalizations over four years, they found that patients who received care from a female physician were more likely to survive and less likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. In fact, about 32,000 fewer people would die each year “if male physicians achieved the same outcomes as female physicians,” the researchers said. Previous studies have suggested that female doctors are more likely to follow clinical guidelines and are more effective communicators.41. Make peace with familyWhile we often stress about small stuff — the guests are here, and we’re not ready! — it’s the nagging, long-running forms of stress, such as a family dispute, that put your longevity at risk. Chronic stress hastens the cellular deterioration that leads to premature aging and a vast array of serious diseases, according to long-running research from the University of California, San Francisco. This sort of cell death “turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of early diseases of aging and in many studies of early mortality,” says lead researcher Elissa Epel. The remedy: Come to peace with the people in your life. Forgive your family, forgive yourself, put the past behind you — so you can have more life in front of you. 42. Take the stairs — every dayA study by University of Geneva researchers found that taking the stairs instead of the elevators reduced the risk of dying prematurely by 15 percent. What’s more, a daily stair climb shaves six months off your “brain age,” according to researchers at Concordia University who performed MRI scans on 331 people ages 19 to 79. Gray matter shrinks naturally with age, but less so when people stay active.43. Toss that rugOne of the top risks for falls at home is throw rugs. Those slip-slidey accoutrements send 38,000 older adults to the emergency room each year, according to a 2013 study by the CDC. Banish these rugs from your home, and make sure bath mats have a nonslip bottom. 44. Beware the high-tech dashNearly one in five traffic accidents and more than 400,000 crash-related injuries involve a distracted driver, the U.S. Department of Transportation reports. Top distractions, according to a recent Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study, are cellphones. But a less-obvious risk is using the touch screen on your car’s dashboard.Geber86Yes, you can go carless and survive.45. And drive lessIn 2014, more than 5,700 older adults were killed and more than 236,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes. Per mile traveled, fatal crashes increase noticeably starting at age 70 and are highest among drivers age 85 and older, a highway safety organization says. If you’re feeling unsafe behind the wheel, it might be time to look for alternative transportation.46. Better yet, walkWhat’s the best prescription for a longer life? Exercise. And doctors are literally prescribing it instead of medication. “There is no pill that comes close to what exercise can do,” says Claude Bouchard, director of the human genomics laboratory at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. It benefits your brain, heart, skin, mood and metabolism. Even as little as 10 minutes of brisk walking can help (that’s all it takes to burn off the calories of one chocolate chip cookie). Once you can do 10 minutes, push it to 15. Then 20. Start slow, but just start.47. Just not in the streetNearly 5,000 pedestrians are killed annually in the U.S., according to the latest federal figures, and nearly 20 percent of those deaths were among adults age 65 and older. If you walk for your health — and we hope you do — stay safe and consider doing so at the mall, a community health center or a park.48. And go a little fasterThe benefits of a brisk walk are real: A University of Pittsburgh study of adults 65 and older found that those whose usual walking pace exceeded one meter per second lived longer. While researchers say they can’t recommend brisk walking as a panacea for living longer, they did see increased survival in those who picked up the pace over the course of a year.49. Get fidgetyNever mind what your grade school teachers said; fidgeting is good. A 2016 British study finds that sitting for seven or more hours a day increases your risk of dying by 30 percent — except among active fidgeters, who see no increased risk. GettyNeed wheels? Go for a smart car.50. Trade in Ol' BessieHigh-tech safety features have now become standard in new cars. The government mandates that all have airbags, antilock brakes, electronic stability control — “up there with seat belts and airbags in its life- aving benefits,” says one industry leader — and tire pressure-monitoring systems. Carmakers also offer back-up cameras, self-parking features, blind-spot and lane-departure warnings, and forward-collision warning with auto-braking.AARP Members Enjoy Health and Wellness Discounts: You can save on eye exams, prescription drugs, hearing aids and morePlease leave your comment below.You must be logged in to leave a comment.Featured AARP Member BenefitsSee All >AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that empowers people to choose how they live as they age.You are leaving AARP.org and going to the website of our trusted provider.

SENIOR CITIZEN HEALTH INSURANCE

Posted on  •  31 Aug 2020We have often heard people talk about the importance of ageing gracefully. For many, it comes quite naturally, especially those who understand and accept the biological changes which happen in old age - wrinkles, sagging skin and health issues.Illnesses especially become a cause of concern for those who have elderly parents or relatives at home. The risk of health conditions like diabetes, heart attack, lung disorders and dementia increases as a person ages. Finding quality healthcare and adequate finances to support can become a challenge without health plans. Investing in senior citizen health insurance is the best thing you can do to ensure the well-being of your aging parents and loved ones.It is essential for senior citizens to realize that ageing can be enjoyable and stress-free if one is focused on leading a healthy lifestyle.We give you some useful tips to follow.While fatigue and lethargy are signs of growing old, elderly individuals should realize that lack of physical activity can be detrimental for their health. It can affect the flexibility of the joints; reduce bone strength and physical endurance as well as increase risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke.Regular exercises or activities such as walking, stretching, gardening, etc. can be highly beneficial for the body. Practicing yoga also immensely improves muscle tone and overall health.Sleep patterns tend to alter as one grows old. Insomnia, sleep apnea and difficulty in getting quality sleep are major problems for many senior citizens.However, sound sleep is integral to maintaining a sound physical and mental health. Adults above the age of 65 years should aim for a minimum of 8 hours of sleep in a day. By fixing a sleep schedule, going to bed early, and following deep breathing and relaxation techniques, senior adults can improve their sleep habits.Life after retirement is the perfect time to pursue one’s hobbies that were once neglected due to hectic work-life. It is extremely important to keep oneself engaged in activities that bring happiness and peace of mind. Activities like solving crossword puzzles, reading and writing greatly enhance memory functions.Identifying stress triggers and knowing how to tackle them is equally essential. Staying socially connected also has a tremendously positive effect on an individual’s mental and physical well-being.Nutritious food over junk food is advisable for a person of any age. Senior citizens must follow a diet depending on their health condition. For instance, those having hypertension should limit their sodium or ‘salt’ intake. Consuming fruits and vegetables are a vital component of a healthy diet. Like food, enough water intake is also essential for maintaining energy levels in the body.Scheduling regular visits to the doctor and diagnostic tests will help in identifying any hidden health problem and controlling it before it worsens. Speaking to a professional about your health conditions will give you new insights to dealing with age-related problems effectively. Whether it is dental care or check-ups for vision and hearing abilities, every effort must be made to ensure health problems are detected early and suitable treatment is sought.Minimize health risks with timely health check-ups. Medical Insurance Plans for senior citizens by Care Health Insurance (Formerly Religare Health Insurance) have annual health check-ups as one of its key features.Health InsuranceMediclaim insuranceTravel InsuranceFOLLOW USQuick linksHEALTH INSURANCETRAVEL INSURANCECORPORATE INSURANCEALREADY A CUSTOMERDOWNLOADOTHER LINKSCONTACT USREAD IN HINDITHINGS TO KNOWHEALTH INSURANCE CITY WISEAbout Care Health InsuranceAbout Care Health InsuranceCHI is a specialized health insurer offering health insurance services to employees of corporates, individual customers, and for financial inclusion as well.

241,https://riseandshine.childrensnational.org/maintaining-healthy-habits-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/,"Making a few simple modifications in your children’s eating and exercise routines may actually lead to positive changes for your children and your family.As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has continued, many of us are finding it difficult to keep up with healthful eating and exercise routines ourselves, let alone to encourage these behaviors in our children. With families balancing multiple responsibilities, and children spending more time at home, it can be challenging to make sure that children are eating nutritious meals and choosing healthy snacks. Additionally, with the closure of parks and recreation facilities, cancelled sports and removal of formal physical education, children have significantly fewer opportunities for exercise. Stay-at-home orders mean that children are taking fewer steps and moving their bodies less.While it may feel daunting to tackle one more area of life right now, making even a few simple modifications in your children’s eating and exercise routines may actually lead to positive changes for your children and your family. For some children, we are seeing that stay-at-home orders and social distancing and worry about contracting the COIVD-19 illness are worsening underlying difficulties with concentration, behavior, mood and stress/anxiety. Fortunately, we know that healthful eating and exercise are linked with improvements in children’s behavior, attention, mood, stress/anxiety levels and sleep, and even with boosting their immune systems. So devoting a little bit of time and effort to these routines may benefit your children’s physical and mental health in multiple ways. Here are a few tips that can help.Children should be eating a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, healthy protein and healthy carbohydrates. Consider having kids help you design a “menu” of choices in each category that they enjoy and eat, and post this menu on the refrigerator or other prominent place in the kitchen. Kids can then mix and match their favorite foods from each category for meals and snacks! Families can make it a fun challenge to incorporate one food from each category into meals and snacks.What are some examples of foods from these categories? All vegetables are great choices! More colorful vegetables, particularly GREEN vegetables, have higher levels of vitamins and nutrients. Especially for lunch, dinner and snacks, encourage children to fill up a quarter to a half of their plate with vegetables. Fruit: All fresh fruit is good, but try to limit dried fruit. The water that naturally occurs in fruit is important for balancing the natural sugar levels and helps to keep us feel full longer. Healthy proteins include: eggs, low-carb dairy, lean meats, fish/seafood, beans and nuts or nut butters. Healthy carbohydrates include whole grains such as whole wheat breads, whole grain crackers, brown rice, quinoa, pure oats and stove-popped popcorn. It is important to choose carbohydrates that are also high in fiber (>3-4 g per serving) and low in added sugar (closer to 0 is better!). The Choose My Plate website has great examples of foods in each category, and Healthyeating.org has some fun kid-friendly games on nutrition.Great snacking ideas that feature vegetables and fruit include: carrots, celery or sliced bell peppers (with hummus, guacamole, or nut butter); apples (with cheese, whole nuts or nut butter); blueberries, strawberries or favorite sliced up fruit (in plain yogurt); veggie pita pocket/roll-up (spread a whole grain tortilla or pita-pocket with hummus and stuff with sliced up veggies); or a veggie and turkey roll up (roll up sliced veggies inside a slice of turkey or other deli meat).Children will only choose healthy food options if they’re available and easily accessible! Before going grocery shopping, sit down as a family and make a grocery list that includes items from your Four Main Food Groups Menu. Consider having a running grocery list (paper, electronic) that has foods that your children enjoy from each of the healthy food categories. Once you are home from the grocery store, set aside time for the whole family to help with prepping the foods. For example, throw on some fun music, have caregivers or older children cut up fruits and vegetables, and let younger children be in charge of putting them away in storage containers. Also consider setting aside some time weekends or other any free times to pre-make components of meals, or making grab & go options for healthy snacks. Then make sure that the healthy options are within easy sight and reach – we’re more likely to choose the sliced cantaloupe or hummus if it’s in the first thing we see in the refrigerator, and the chips and candy are out of sight in the back of the pantry!Experts recommend that children achieve 60 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day, which is any movement that gets their heart rate up! Physical activity can occur all at once or through bursts throughout the day, so even a few minutes of movement at a time can be very helpful. Children are naturally active, but as they are spending most of their time at home, they no longer have opportunities for movement during transitions between activities. While routines are disrupted, families may find it helpful to create visual daily schedules with times for school/learning, creativity, fun, meals and sleep, as well as scheduled times for outdoor activity, movement breaks and “recess” or sports “practice.” Caregivers can also consider setting daily limits on screen times or having portions of the day that are “no screen” periods. But be easy on yourself – screen time is likely to be higher than normal these days!Below is an example daily routine that families can modify to make it work for their needs. When school is not in session, families can swap in alternative options for “academic time,” such as chores, learning or play. The areas in green are scheduled times for movement.While children are indoors, consider using online exercise videos that are family friendly. The following websites have a variety of movement ideas for children and families: yoga (www.cosmickids.org), fun movement and mindfulness (www.gonoodle.com), indoor recess (www.playwords.org) and indoor exercise classes through the YMCA (www.ymca360.org). For kids who are missing physical education, PBS has a variety of online classes. And it may be fun to have a daily family dance parties, such as before or after dinner!If you have a backyard or secluded outdoor area, try creating “no touch” scavenger hunts in which children can look for colors, shapes, flowers/plants or animals and check them off a list. Find a nearby sidewalk or empty parking lot to draw pictures with chalk or play hopscotch. On days with more time to prepare, create an obstacle course with challenges to run laps or jump over objects. During the warmer months, encourage kids to take part in outdoor chores such as raking, weeding or planting the garden. Fortunately, the gradual opening of parks and outdoor hiking areas offers a lot more opportunity for outdoor physical activity – just make sure to practice social distancing (stay 6 feet apart from other people), and bring your masks along! And for children who are missing sports, they can practice their moves or drills in the backyard or a secluded outdoor area (such as a park, empty parking lot), or some coaches may be willing to provide practice or lessons via video chat.Children are more likely to engage in any activity or routine when it’s fun! When prepping food or planning meals, throw on some music and make it a “food prep party.” For younger kids, try cutting sandwiches into fun shapes or making a smiley face out of carrots and tomatoes. If you are creating family schedules with times for exercise/movement, let kids decorate their schedules to add some individual creativity. And adding in some friendly competition can be especially fun and motivating for children and teens of all ages – try challenging your family to see who can get the most steps in a day, who can have the most colorful plate at dinner or try the most new vegetables in the week, or who can have the craziest dance move during the family dance party!Children love to be involved! When they are included, you send the message that they are valued and important, and they will be more likely to become invested in the activity. It’s also a great way to learn about their interests and their suggestions, which will go a long way in keeping them engaged. Children should be included in the grocery list planning, prepping snacks and meals or cooking. They will also be excited to help with creating family goal charts for movement, or helping to pick out online exercise videos. Having a position of leadership, such as the “Family Mask Checker” (who makes sure everyone is wearing their mask before the evening walk), can also be especially fun for younger kids.For most children, spending more time moving and exercising will be fun, and they will be motivated to choose healthy food options when they are involved in the process. To keep all children motivated, and especially to encourage those children who having a difficult time making changes, remember to provide praise and give them positive attention. Praise should be specific, so they know exactly what it was that they did well (for example, “Great job moving your body today!”; “I really like how you chose a healthy snack”; or “I love going on morning walks with you”). And remember, children look to caregivers for guidance, so making healthy choices should be a family goal and modeled by caregivers. So creating family goal charts and displaying them prominently may be a great way to keep everyone motivated! Children will be especially motivated to add check marks or stickers when they meet their daily goals. For children who need extra motivation, you may consider creating a reward system to go along with the daily/weekly goal charts. And remember – rewards do not need to cost money, they just need to be motivating for your child.Email Address * ",6.7725,9.88,4.65,9.28,3.28,1649

If you are the type of person that likes to plan out everything on your agenda, don’t forget to insert time slots to remind yourself to eat a snack or a meal. This note will help you to remember to eat something even if you are busy running around or working on homework. Having a snack break will also help you to take a break and let your brain relax for a moment after long hours of hard work.Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. People often forget to drink water when they are busy. However, the body needs water to carry out appropriate functions, especially our brain function. When dehydrated, your cognitive function will decline and your brain will not be working efficiently. Carry a reusable water bottle with you all the time and refill it at the water stations around campus. Different applications on the market can remind you to drink water throughout the day. Choose the better protein or granola bars. Try not to replace a meal with these bars. The nutrients in the bar are not enough to make your body function well. These bars are more like snacks that offer a quick source of energy when the body is low in energy. When buying energy bars, check the ingredient list to ensure you know familiar with what goes into the bars. My general rule is, if the name sounds too strange, I will not buy it. With some planning, you can make homemade bars to adjust to your own needs and flavors. Pack your own snacks. You can pack fruits, vegetables or nuts to eat during the day. Some snack ideas are apple slices with almond butter, pretzels with hummus or trail mix. You know what goes into your snack when you make or pack it yourself. It will also help you save a substantial amount of money in the long run. Most importantly, snacking throughout the day can also prevent overeating or eating less nutrient dense meals later. Make healthier choices in restaurants. Many people choose to eat out when they feel like they do not have enough time to cook. Identifying and ordering a more nutritious option in a restaurant is easier than you think. Try to choose dishes that contain mostly vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Consider adding various side dishes to create a balanced meal. Additionally, pay attention to the portion size offered. Restaurants often serve portions that are too much for one person to finish, so you should not feel obligated to finish everything on the plate. To avoid overeating, consider splitting a meal with a friend, ask for a smaller portion or put half of the plate in a to-go box for another time.  This blog post was written by Nutrition Outreach Worker, Lucy Yu.Berkeley, CA 94720-4300Email: telltang@berkeley.edueTang secure messagingCopyright © 2021 UC Regents; all rights reserved

Our health is most determined by where we live, including whether we have access to healthy foods, opportunities to safely be active outside, and a network that encourages us to be healthy. 5-2-1-0 is a community-wide effort, led by United Way of Central Iowa, that encourages families to practice these healthy daily habits:A big part of this effort is changing our schools, child care centers, health care clinics, and communities to make these habits the easy choices for families to make. We encourage everyone to play their part in making central Iowa healthy. Here are five ways you can improve health in your community.It starts with all of us making a commitment to live 5-2-1-0 every day. Make your house the place where you serve a variety of colorful fruits and veggies, serve water to drink, and take an hour to play active games. Find tips and creative ideas at www.5210dsm.org or follow @5210dsm on Facebook and Pinterest.Schools become healthier when parents speak up. Seek opportunities to volunteer or join groups/committees at your child's school or the school district. Encourage all fundraisers to have healthy options and encourage your child's classroom celebrations to feature non-food treats or healthy alternatives. Ask your district about its local wellness policy that guides student health efforts and how you can help update it. Find lots of ideas at Iowa's Team Nutrition. Many cities are considering proposals that focus on creating safe walking routes and places to play and increase access to trails and other opportunities to exercise. MoveDSM is a transportation master plan that outlines a course to advance work around creating a complete and safe transportation network in Des Moines for all users. The Central Iowa Well Kids Coalition is advancing initiatives like this one through our advocacy agenda. Join a community garden or your Giving Garden at work (better yet, start a Giving Garden at your workplace!) and help harvest produce to donate to local food pantries. Or when donating to food pantries, make sure you're giving healthy options, including low-sodium canned food. If you're hosting an event, look into food rescue options for your leftovers--especially if you're making your food choices healthy. Learn more about food rescue from Eat Greater Des Moines. Help encourage kids to spend less time on screens and more time getting exercise and reading. United Way offers a lot of options to mentor kids in reading, as well as to engage in other volunteer activities.

1.	Drink more water. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.
2.	Get enough sleep. When you don’t sleep, You tend to eat more. Usually only junk food.
3.	Exercise. Not just a few times a week, but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially increase your life span.
4.	Eat more fruits and vegetables. All fruits and vegetables carry vitamins and minerals, components essential to your health. It’s suggested that we consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to maintain health.
5.	Eat the rainbow. Pick brightly-colored foods in the produce aisle. These are high in antioxidants (antioxidants remove free radicals in our body that damage our cells) and make a more appealing plate. Here are a few examples to look out for:
•	White (Bananas, Mushrooms)
•	Yellow (Pineapples, Mangoes)
•	Orange (Oranges, Papayas)
•	Red (Apples, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelons)
•	Green (Guavas, Avocados, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Celery)
•	Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplants, Prunes)
6.	Cut down on processed foods. Processed foods are simply not good for you. Most nutritional value is lost in the making of processed foods and the added preservatives are bad for our health. These foods contain a high amount of salt, which leads to high blood pressure and heart disease. In general, the more ingredients on the label, the more processed the item.
7.	Avoid negative people in your life. A positive mentality is key for a healthy life. You don’t need negativity in your life. If you feel that a person or friend is negative, just let him or her go.
8.	Avoid negativity within yourself. You don’t need negativity from yourself, either. Let go of all negative thoughts within yourself. Overeating tends to happen when one feels unhappy, so by staying in a positive state of mind, you cut out an unhealthy dependence on food to be happy.
9.	Avoid trigger foods. These are foods you can’t put down after one bite. Everyone’s trigger foods are different, but typically they consist of candy bars, chocolate, chips, cookies, or anything with high levels of refined sugar, salt, fat or flour.
10.	 Take your time eating. Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Don’t rely on a clean plate to tell you when it’s time to stop eating.
11.	 Prepare your meals. When you prepare meals yourself, you control exactly what goes in to them. This makes it easier for you to make the right healthy choices for your body.
12.	 Move toward low calorie and low fat alternatives. There are many low-fat or non-fat alternatives readily available in all grocery stores. Try switching your full-fat pantry staples for low-fat versions over a period of time.
13.	 Stop smoking. Smoking is bad, period. If you’re a smoker, quit for better health—not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. If you don’t smoke, stay that way.
14.	 Have healthy snacks on hand. Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the right things is what matters most. When turning to snacks during your day, look for things like fruit, salad, or freshly squeezed juices not from concentrate. These are nutritional and won’t give you a sugar crash.

Personal Success
There has never been a time in human history where you can live longer and live better than you can today. Incredible advances in pharmaceuticals, medicine, and healthcare enable people to overcome disease and illness and continue to thrive well into their 80s and 90s.Perhaps the largest growing demographic group in America today is people who are 90 and 100 years old or more. Your job is to join this group and to be fit and healthy all the days of your life.For almost the entire history of the human race, longevity was a matter of accident or coincidence…Today longevity is a matter of design and choice.You can actually decide today to enjoy superb levels of physical health, and by developing specific habits, you can assure that you live longer and better than has been possible for any other generation in human history.More than 60% of Americans today are officially classified as “obese.” This means that they are more than 20% above their ideal weight, based on height and weight charts. Even worse, there are many millions who are officially classified as “morbidly obese.” This means that they are 40% and 50% above their ideal weights.Everything you are, and ever will be, is the result of your choices and decisions. If you want to change some aspect of your life, you have to make new choices and new decisions, and then you must discipline yourself to follow through on your decisions.The only way to achieve your proper weight is to develop the habit of eating less and exercising more each day and each week. But just as it takes you months and years to become overweight, it takes you many months to get rid of the weight once you make that decision.It is not easy to lose weight.This is because you develop automatic habits of eating that are hard to break. You get into a rhythm of eating certain foods – morning, noon and night. You become accustomed to eating snacks between meals, and to overeating in the evening. It is not easy to break these habits, but it is definitely possible.This is your goal.The first habit you need to develop for a long life full of health and fitness is the habit of eating a proper diet.You have to develop the habit of eating the right foods, in the right proportions, at the right times.Everyone knows that they should eat a more balanced diet, containing more fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products.In addition to this basic principle, there are several things that you can do to modify your diet and develop the habits of good nutrition, which will lead to a combination of weight loss and higher levels of energy and fitness.In addition to eating the right foods, you should develop the habit of eliminating the “three white poisons” from your diet, which are salt, sugar, and flour.This change in your diet is so simple and yet so powerful that every one of my students who tries it is absolutely amazed at how quickly they get noticeable results.The next habit you need to develop is the habit of effective exercise.Many people stop exercising in their late teens and early twenties, even people who were active in sports when they were growing up. The human body is meant to be exercised regularly throughout your life.Develop the habit of articulating and moving every joint in your body, every single day. This keeps your muscles and joints agile and flexible. Regular exercise assures that you have greater balance and mobility. It helps to diminish the likelihood of muscle or joint pain or problems.Develop the habit of exercising 200 minutes each week. If all you did were to go for a walk, 30 minutes per day, seven days per week, you would be one of the fittest people in our society.If you disciplined yourself to ride an exercise bicycle, work out on a treadmill, swim, jog or engage in any aerobic exercises that get your lungs and heart pumping, you will dramatically improve your levels of health and energy in a short period of time.The third habit that you need for superb all around health is the habit of proper rest. You need seven to eight hours of sleep each night for optimal performance. If you get less than six to seven hours of sleep per night, and you continue to work as hard as you normally do at your job, you will eventually develop a “sleep deficiency.”You can change the way you feel about yourself, and your performance in your work and personal life, by developing the habit of going to bed early, by 10:00 pm each night and getting a good night’s sleep every night of the week.Get my free report Living By Your Personal Code to change the entire way you think about yourself and the way you live your life. In it you’ll learn:To learn how to form more great habits that will lead you to success, check out my recent post 7 Goal Oriented Habits Of Successful People.

But what exactly does that mean? And how can it help prevent cancer?You’re probably thinking it translates to “eat right and exercise.” And that’s a big part of it, says Karen Basen-Engquist, Ph.D., director of the Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship at MD Anderson.But a healthy lifestyle is much more than just diet and physical activity, she says.1. Maintain a healthy weightFirst and foremost,maintaining a healthy weight is one of the best things you can do to do live healthy and lower your cancer risk.What matters about your weight is the amount of body fat you carry around. A higher percentage puts you at risk for cancer, heart disease and diabetes.A handful of factors can contribute to your weight, including your diet, activity levels, genes and age. Basen-Engquist suggests ways you can stay lean.2. Use good judgment with alcohol“Excess alcohol consumption has been linked to several cancers, including breast cancer and esophageal cancer,” Basen-Engquist says.On the other hand, several recent studies have found low or moderate alcohol consumption may lower your risk of death from all causes.If you don’t already drink, don’t start, Basen-Engquist says. But if you enjoy alcohol, keeping your habit to one drink a day for women or two for men is a good goal, she adds.3. Get your beauty sleep“We can’t live or function without sleep – it enables us to accomplish the things we want to in life,” says Diwakar Balachandran, M.D., medical director in the MD Anderson Sleep Center.Plus, research shows chronic sleep loss may lead to weight gain and other health problems, including cancer.“We need to give sleep the priority it deserves,” Balachandran says. Most adults need roughly seven to eight hours of solid ZZZs every night. Not getting enough sleep? These eight healthy sleep habits can help.4. Avoid tobaccoThis is one of the biggies. Research shows tobacco use is the cause of 25% to 30% of cancer deaths. But despite those risks, roughly one in five adults still smokes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   “People tend to know very little when it comes to the dangers of smoking,” says Alexander Prokhorov, M.D., Ph.D., professor of behavioral science at MD Anderson. What you should know, he says, is that all tobacco products – including e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco – are dangerous and contain cancer-causing chemicals. So, using tobacco any in any form puts your life at risk.Also, you should avoid secondhand smoke. “It can cause lung cancer in non-smokers and is associated with heart disease and asthma attacks,” Prokhorov says. No level of exposure is safe, he warns.If you’re ready to quit tobacco, these free resources can help.5. Be smart in the sunIt takes more than a little sunscreen to avoid skin cancer, including its deadliest form, melanoma.Most people don’t apply enough sunscreen and don’t reapply it often enough.To protect your skin:In addition, avoid tanning beds. They emit the same harmful UV rays as the sun and cause skin cancer. In fact, starting indoor tanning before age 18 may increase a user’s melanoma risk by 85%.6. Get screenedCancer screening exams are medical tests done when you don’t have any signs of illness. They can help find cancer early, when the chances for successfully treating the disease are greatest.Follow MD Anderson’s recommendations for screening exams, and talk to your doctor. He or she can help determine which exams are right for you.“All of this may seem like a lot to take on,” Basen-Engquist says. “But you don’t have to make all of these changes overnight to start seeing the health benefits.”To get started, she recommends adopting just one or two of these healthy habits. Once you’ve grown used to them, you can gradually add the others to your healthy lifestyle.Request an appointment at MD Anderson's Lyda Hill Cancer Prevention Center online or call 877-632-6789.You don’t have to make all of these changes overnight to start seeing
the health benefits.

          1 December 2020        

                  Whatever your reasons for it, vegetarian and vegan diets are becoming more popular than ever among students. Here are 8 tips to help you to stay healthy on a veggie/vegan diet.              A healthy diet without meat (and dairy) sometimes takes a little extra planning, but put in the little extra thought required and your body and wallet will thank you! Here are some ways that I found helped me to stay healthy on a plant-based diet on a student budget:Doing your research is vital to thriving on a plant-based diet. Vitamin deficiencies are common in all diets, not just plant-based diets and can really affect your energy levels and performance. With a little research, there are easy ways to make sure you are getting all the essential vitamins and nutrients you need to be on form!Tip: The main ones to keep an eye on are iron, B12, calcium, and Omega 3. And remember to include Vitamin C rich foods to help your body absorb the iron in your meals. For more info check out The Vegan Society.Although you have done your research - it is important to ensure that your GP or General Practitioner (which is the term used for a doctor in the UK) is aware of your diet and that you take any tests to ensure that you have no deficiencies that would hinder your health and your studies! Your GP can then advise you on any supplements that you may need to be taking. Find out more about registering with a GP.Beans on toast is possibly the easiest student vegan meal you can make – but you don’t want to be eating it every time you come home from a long day of lectures and have zero inspiration to cook! Planning what you are going to eat for the week and preparing your lunches the night before, are going to make the difference between you merely surviving and you thriving on a plant-based diet. Tip: Try getting into the habit of prepping a large veggie curry/ bake on a Sunday which will last you for a few days. Bring nuts/seeds/fruit with you to uni to help balance your blood sugar levels throughout the day and avoid those afternoon energy drops. Some of my personal favourites are protein energy bars, dried fruit, nuts, almond butter, and apple slices or Hummus and carrot sticks.Particularly when you are cooking for one! Make big meals and freeze half of it in single portions. Trust me – when it comes to writing essays/revision period, you will thank your earlier less stressed self! If you have been doing this over a few months you will be able to pull out a different meal each day before you head to the library and it will be defrosted and ready to heat up when you return!(Tip: if you are short on freezer space try using zip lock freezer bags – lay flat and stack once frozen. Be sure to write the contents on the bag!)Smoothies are a great way to pack in a lot of nutrients with both protein and fruit/veggies and will get you through those mornings when you have back to back lectures. There are some great student budget-friendly options on the market.(Tip: To save precious morning time prepare your smoothies and store in the freezer in separate zip lock bags. Add your preferred milk in the morning and any nut butter/protein powder and voila your iced smoothie is ready to go)A big part of staying healthy as a veggie or vegan is about thinking outside of the box and trying to find healthy homemade versions of your old favourites. Removing meat/dairy from your diet gives you the space to experiment and introduce lots of new healthy things. I had never heard of quinoa, kale, chia seeds, okra, chard, tempeh, miso, seitan etc. and now these are staples of my diet. Luckily unless you are constantly splashing out on Seitan, veggie/vegan shopping lists are very student-friendly as they are generally MUCH cheaper as we generally eat beans, rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables – the cheapest ingredients on earth! Luckily these days, we're are spoiled for choice when it comes to veggie options and vegan cafes are popping up everywhere. If you are studying on campus, London is full of great places to eat there are lots of online resources such as HappyCow (and the app!) which have already done a lot of the work for you! If you're studying remotely away from London, have a search online for your nearest veggie and vegan restaurants - there's bound to be one near you.Many people thrive on a plant-based diet, however be sure to listen to your body and always do what is best for you! These are just some of the ways you can stay healthy as a veggie/vegan at UCL but if you want to know more, check out the UCLU Vegan and Vegetarian society!By Nichola Carroll , UCL alumna, BA Modern LanguagesTweets by @UCLcares",6.865,9.74,5.36,9.1,3.26,866
249,https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/healthy-living/c/covid-19-staying-healthy-in-a-lockdown/,"With the whole country in lockdown due to COVID-19, it’s more important than ever to stay healthy, physically and mentally.If you are not used to being at home every day, suddenly finding yourself confined to your house – be it on your own or with family members or flatmates – for several weeks may seem daunting. But, it’s doable with a little planning, kindness and understanding.Remember almost everyone in New Zealand is in the same situation and it won’t last forever. While it does, we're all going to have to get a bit more creative with things like exercising and staying in contact with each other. Here are our top 10 tips for staying healthy while in self-isolation:Plan out a routine and stick to it. Having structure in your day gives you a sense of stability and peace of mind. For example, get up and go to bed at the same time you usually would and have your meals at the usual time. Make sure you get your normal amount of sleep. Plan different things for your weekend or day off so you can get a break from your routine, just as you normally would. Go outside for a walk or run – it’s good for your physical and mental health. Again, plan it into your schedule so you are doing it every day. Getting out of the house will make you feel better and reduce cabin fever.Make sure you’re getting your 5 plus a day of fruit and vegetables to stay healthy. Avoid unnecessary snacking which is easy to do when you’re at home. Keep your eating habits as close as possible to what you would usually do. An excess of alcohol is especially risky at this time, so keep to standard drinking advice and find other ways to relieve stress.A lack of face to face contact with others is tough. However, there are lots of other ways to stay in touch. Pick up the phone, video call friends or family and stay in touch online. Start an online neighbourhood group to keep an eye on each other. You could also throw a virtual party where a group gets together online and connects that way. There are also lots of resources and ideas on the internet to keep you occupied and connected.Set aside time each day or week to exercise inside, in the garage or in the garden. It could be yoga, weights, dancing or other forms of exercise. There are many websites offering free virtual exercise classes. It’s also a great time to get stuck into the garden, mow the lawns, clean the house and trim the hedge. See also exercising while staying at home.If you've suddenly find yourself with time on your hands, remember to do something you enjoy. Watch a movie, do some puzzles, play some board games, write that novel, read, redecorate, play charades, start to learn language or do anything else that will put a smile on your face.While it’s important to stay connected digitally, make sure you do have a break from it and balance your use. Plan times to be digitally connected and times when you switch to 'do not disturb' and become fully present to life in your bubble. It’s tempting to keep checking all the latest updates about COVID-19 but don’t let it rule your life. Keep informed but also a have a break from the constant flow of information. Have set times where you check the news, maybe morning and night to keep a healthy balance.Meditation is proven to have many mental and physical benefits. As does practising mindfulness. They are both free to do and will improve your health and help you stay calm and centred.If you feel unwell and need to see a doctor or you suspect you have COVID-19, then phone your GP to make an appointment or phone the dedicated Coronavirus Healthline on 0800 358 5453 for advice.

by Lisa Tran, Student Experience Coordinator at Make SchoolCollege is an exciting time filled with transitions, challenges, and personal growth. This is a transformative period where students are emerging into early adulthood, finding their independence, and forming their identities. However, those years can also be overwhelmingly stressful. If students don't have healthy coping strategies to minimize the potential negative impacts of being in a rigorous academic program, they may put their mental and physical health at risk.  Knowing how to practice self-care is one of the easiest ways to prevent burnout, minimize stress, and ward off other health concerns.Self-care was a foreign concept to me until I started grad school at the University of San Francisco, where I received a Master's in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in Marriage and Family Therapy. I took a class in Trauma and Crisis Counseling and on the first day, my professor shared a metaphor that has stuck with me ever since. You know that spiel they give you on an airplane where they tell you to put on your oxygen mask first before helping someone else with theirs? They say that because if you don't have oxygen, you're not able to help others.Whether you end up in a helping profession or not after college, think of self-care as your ""oxygen mask"" that will enable you to function as a student, relative, friend, significant other, and any other identity that you may carry with you every day. Take care of yourself first, and everything else will get a little easier.Now, as Make School's Student Experience Coordinator, I always make an effort to explore how our students are incorporating self-care into their lives. Our students' overall wellness is a top priority at Make School and we want them to come out of here with the tools to be great software engineers as well as healthy individuals with a meaningful work-life balance.Check in with yourself -- mentally and physically: Stress looks different for everyone so having self-awareness about your personal experience is crucial to understanding what you need to take care of yourself. Thoughts like, ""I don't think I can handle this"" or ""This is too much for me"" are usually indicators that you should probably take some time to rest. Stress can also manifest in physical symptoms like feeling tired, shortness of breath, tight chest, and body aches, among other things. Taking the time to check in with yourself and understand where things are coming from is the first step to practicing self-care.Take a deep breath: Learning to practice deep breathing can help ground you when you're feeling overwhelmed. Deep, intentional breaths allow you to take a pause and be present in your body. Use this breathing gif to help guide your deep breaths.Create a sleep hygiene routine: Pulling all-nighters to study for an upcoming exam, type up a paper, or finish writing code is common amongst college students. However, sleep deprivation can impair cognitive functioning -- which is counterproductive to being a successful student. Good sleep hygiene, also known as sleeping habits, involves going to bed at a consistent time, having a comfortable sleeping environment, and getting the recommended hours of rest every night. For specific recommendations on creating a sleep hygiene routine, check out Harvard Medical School's 12 Simple Tips to Improve Your Sleep. For additional tips on how to fall asleep faster and enjoy your sleep, check out this report.Stay hydrated and eat regularly: Your body needs to be properly fueled to function -- consider yourself to be a plant, but with emotions. This means listening to your body by drinking water and making healthy eating choices. Always having a reusable water bottle with you can serve as a physical reminder to drink more water. This bottle from Amazon is under $10 and it has time markers to help you measure how much you're drinking throughout the day. If you need a digital reminder, Plant Nanny is a fun app that helps you track your water intake -- the more you drink, the more you water your digital plant.Move your body: Being a student often means adopting a sedentary lifestyle because you're constantly sitting in class, typing behind your laptop, or reading a textbook. This can take a toll on your body, so getting in the habit of incorporating at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine can be extremely helpful in keeping your body healthy. Take a break and hit the gym, go for a walk, or have a dance party in your room -- do whatever it takes to get your body moving!Soak in the sunshine: Some studies have found that Vitamin D from the sun can have a positive mood-boosting effect on people. When you're feeling low, step outside for some fresh air and get a natural dose of Vitamin D to re-energize!Make a playlist with your favorite songs: Have you ever heard your favorite song come on and instantly felt better? Try making a playlist filled with all the songs that make you feel good and listen to it when you need a boost -- don't be afraid to completely rock out.Use your senses as a way to self-soothe: Engage your senses in a relaxing activity. Eat your favorite snack, light a candle, take a warm shower/bath with your favorite bath products, or wrap yourself in a soft, cozy blanket -- happy senses makes for a happy you.Set boundaries and learn to say ""no"": This one is easier said than done, but learning this skill can make a huge difference. Students often over-exert themselves by saying ""yes"" to too many things (i.e., staying up all night, social outings, committing to too many extracurricular activities, etc.). However, it's totally ok to say ""no"" sometimes and put your well-being first. Prioritize what's essential and consider turning down anything else that may deplete your energy.Identify a support system: Asking for help can seem like a daunting task, but I reassure you that reaching out for support is not a sign of weakness. It's helpful to have a few family members or friends you know you can call, text, or hang out with when you need to talk. Once you've identified these people, reach out to them and let them know how much they mean to you and ask if it's okay for you to call them in times of need. You can also always schedule an appointment with your college's Counseling Center if you'd prefer to have confidential conversations with a trained professional. Whatever your preferred method, know that you have a community waiting to support you.Self-care can take many other forms, but I hope these ten starting recommendations inspire you to create a self-care routine that works for you.

So there isn’t a one-size-fits-all 'diabetes diet' for everyone with diabetes. But we’ve come up with tips that you can use to help you make healthier food choices. These healthy eating tips are general and can help you manage your blood glucose (sugar), blood pressure and cholesterol levels. They can also help you manage your weight and reduce the risk of diabetes complications, such as heart problems and strokes, and other health conditions including certain types of cancers.  We've based our tips on research involving people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If you have a different type of diabetes, like gestational, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or MODY, some of these tips are relevant to you. It’s important, whatever kind of diabetes you have, to see your dietitian for specific advice.If you or someone you know is self-isolating, find out how to eat healthily whilst staying at home. And you can get even more advice about eating healthily with diabetes in our interactive Learning Zone, including simple and realistic food hacks you can make.If you have type 1 diabetes, carb counting is really important to keep your blood glucose levels steady. This is where you estimate how many carbs are in your meal and match it with how much insulin you need to take.If you have type 2 and you’re overweight, finding a way to lose weight is important as it really improves diabetes management. This is because it can help to lower your blood glucose and reduce your risk of other complications. There are different ways of doing this like the low-carb, Mediterranean or very low-calorie diets. Losing weight can help you lower your blood glucose levels, and we now know that substantial weight loss can even put some people's type 2 diabetes into remission.Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you might need to lose, gain or maintain your current weight but it’s important to make healthier food choices while you’re doing this.Portion sizes are important to think about whether you have type 1 or type 2. It makes calculating nutritional facts when you’re carb counting or managing your weight a lot easier. Remember, portion sizes are different for everyone, so what’s right for someone else might not be right for you.If you feel overwhelmed about your feelings about food and diabetes, we have plenty of information to help you.Download our top tips (PDF).All carbs affect blood glucose levels so it’s important to know which foods contain carbohydrates. Choose the healthier foods that contain carbs and be aware of your portion sizes.Here are some healthy sources of carbohydrate:At the same time, it’s also important to cut down on foods low in fibre such as white bread, white rice and highly-processed cereals. You can check food labels when you’re looking for foods high in fibre if you’re unsure.Eating lots of salt can increase your risk of high blood pressure, which in turn increases risk of heart diseases and stroke. And when you have diabetes, you’re already more at risk of all of these conditions.Try to limit yourself to a maximum of 6g (one teaspoonful) of salt a day. Lots of pre-packaged foods already contain salt so remember to check food labels and choose those with less salt. Cooking from scratch will help you keep an eye on how much salt you’re eating. You can also get creative and swap out salt for different types of herbs and spices to add that extra flavour.If you’re cutting down on carbs, you might start to have bigger portions of meat to fill you up. But it’s not a good idea to do this with red and processed meat, like ham, bacon, sausages, beef and lamb. These all have links with heart problems and cancers.Try swapping red and processed meat for these:Beans, peas and lentils are also very high in fibre and don’t affect your blood glucose levels too much – making them a great swap for processed and red meat and keeping you feeling full. Most of us know that fish is good for us, but oily fish like salmon and mackerel are even better. These are rich in something called omega-3 oil, which helps protect your heart. Try and aim to eat two portions of oily fish a week.We know eating fruit and veg is good for you. It’s always a good thing aim to eat more at meal times and have them as snacks if you’re hungry. This can help you get the vitamins, minerals and fibre your body needs every day to help keep you healthy.You might be wondering about fruit and if you should avoid it because it’s sugary? The answer is no. Whole fruit is good for everyone and if you have diabetes, it’s no different. Fruits do contain sugar, but it’s natural sugar. This is different to the added sugar (also known as free sugars) that are in things like chocolate, biscuits and cakes.Products like fruit juices also count as added sugar, so go for whole fruit instead. This can be fresh, frozen, dried or tinned (in juice, not in syrup). And it’s best to eat it throughout the day instead of one bigger portion in one go.We all need fat in our diet because it gives us energy. But different types of fat affect our health in different ways.Healthier fats are in foods like unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados, oily fish, olive oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Some saturated fats can increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood, increasing your risk of heart problems. These are mainly found in animal products and prepared food like:It’s still a good idea to cut down on using oils in general, so try to grill, steam or bake foods instead.We know cutting out sugar can be really hard at the beginning, so small practical swaps are a good starting point when you’re trying to cut down on excess sugar. Swapping sugary drinks, energy drinks and fruit juices with water, plain milk, or tea and coffee without sugar can be a good start.You can always try low or zero-calorie sweeteners (also known as artificial sweeteners) to help you cut back. Cutting out these added sugars can help you control your blood glucose levels and help keep your weight down. If your diabetes treatment means you get hypos, and you use sugary drinks to treat them, this is still important for your diabetes management and you shouldn’t cut this out. However, if you are having regular hypos it is really important to discuss this with your diabetes team.If you want a snack, choose yoghurts, unsalted nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables instead of crisps, chips, biscuits and chocolates. But watch your portions still – it’ll help you keep an eye on your weightAlcohol is high in calories, so if you do drink and you’re trying to lose weight, think about cutting back. Try to keep to a maximum of 14 units a week. But spread it out to avoid binge drinking, and go several days a week without alcohol.If you take insulin or other diabetes medications, it’s also not a good idea to drink on an empty stomach. This is because alcohol can make hypos more likely to happen.To say food is a ""diabetic food"" is now against the law. This is because there isn’t any evidence that these foods offer you a special benefit over eating healthily. They can also often contain just as much fat and calories as similar products, and can still affect your blood glucose level. These foods can also sometimes have a laxative effect.There’s no evidence that mineral and vitamin supplements help you manage your diabetes. So, unless you’ve been told to take something by your healthcare team, like folic acid for pregnancy, you don’t need to take supplements.It’s better to get your essential nutrients by eating a mixture of different foods. This is because some supplements can affect your medications or make some diabetes complications worse, like kidney disease.Being more physically active goes hand in hand with eating healthier. It can help you manage your diabetes and also reduce your risk of heart problems. This is because it increases the amount of glucose used by your muscles and helps the body use insulin more efficiently.Try to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week. This is any activity that raises your heart rate, makes you breathe faster and feel warmer. You should still be able to talk and only be slightly out of breath. And you don’t have to do all 150 minutes in one go. Break it down into bite-size chunks of 10 minutes throughout the week or 30 minutes 5 times a week.Back to the topOur Learning Zone dispels myths, has easy food hacks, and lets people with diabetes tell their story about the lifestyle changes they made and the benefits it had.Someone is diagnosed with diabetes every two minutes.

It’s the state of physical, mental, and social well-being. Ultimately, it’s the key to living a productive and satisfying life.You can break down the concept of health into different categories. These could include physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral health. There are things any person can do to stay healthy in these areas. But as a teenager, there are some things you should pay special attention to.The doctor might do any of the following to help you stay healthy:Provide immunizations (shots or vaccines) to reduce your risk of getting diseases. These could include meningitis, tetanus, or HPV.Yes; 65% of all deaths in adults are caused by heart disease, cancer, and stroke. In many cases, these diseases are preventable. Many of the behaviors that cause these diseases begin at a young age. For example, teens who use tobacco are more likely to have heart disease, cancer, or stroke in adulthood.The top killers of teenagers and young adults are car accidents, unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide. Cancer and heart disease are uncommon for teenagers, but can affect you at this age. Unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections can harm your health. They can also cause you social and personal problems.Yes. Young men don’t wear seat belts as often as young women do. They’re also more likely to carry weapons, get into physical fights, use smokeless tobacco or marijuana, drink alcohol heavily, and have more sexual partners. On the other hand, young women have some special risks. They try to commit suicide more often. They also try to lose weight in harmful ways more often than young men.Yes.

255,https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/A-Teenagers-Nutritional-Needs.aspx,"A surge in appetite around the age of ten in girls and twelve in boys foreshadows the growth spurt of puberty. How much of a surge? Let's just say that Mom and Dad might want to oil the hinges on the refrigerator door and start stockpiling a small cache of their own favorite snacks underneath the bed.Calories are the measurement used to express the energy delivered by food. The body demands more calories during early adolescence than at any other time of life. Typically, the ravenous hunger starts to wane once a child has stopped growing, though not always. Kids who are big and tall or who participate in physical activity will still need increased amounts of energy into late adolescence. During middle and late adolescence, girls eat roughly 25% fewer calories per day than boys do; consequently, they are more likely to be deficient in vitamins and minerals.The nutrients protein, carbohydrates, and fats in food serve as the body's energy sources. Of the three nutrients, we're least concerned about protein. Not because it isn't important—50% of our body weight is made up of protein—but because adolescents in the United States get twice as much protein as they need. The densest sources of protein include teenage favorites such as:Carbohydrates, found in starches and sugars, get converted into the body's main fuel: the simple sugar glucose. Not all carbs are created equal, however. In planning meals, we want to push complex-carbohydrate foods and go easy on simple carbohydrates. Complex carbs provide sustained energy; that's why you often see marathon runners and other athletes downing big bowls of pasta before competing. As a bonus, many starches deliver fiber and assorted nutrients too. They are truly foods of substance: filling yet low in fat. Fat should make up no more than 30% of the diet. Fat supplies energy and assists the body in absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E, and K. But these benefits must be considered next to its many adverse effects on health. A teenager who indulges in a fat-heavy diet is going to put on weight, even if he's active. It would take a workout befitting an Olympic athlete to burn off excess fat calories day after day.Fatty foods contain cholesterol, a waxy substance that can clog an artery and eventually cause it to harden. The danger of atherosclerosis is that the blockage will affect one of the blood vessels leading to the heart or the brain, setting off a heart attack or a stroke. Although these life-threatening events usually don't strike until later in adult life, the time to start practicing prevention is now, by reducing the amount of fat in your family's diet. Dietary fat contains varying proportions of three types:You want to limit your family's intake of saturated fat to no more than 10% of your total daily calories. The other 20% of daily calories from dietary fat should come equally from the two unsaturated kinds of fat, both of which are contained mainly in plant oils. If your family eats a lot of packaged and processed foods: Make a habit of reading the food labels. You may be surprised to see how much fat, sugar, and salt (sodium), is in the foods you eat every day. And almost all packaged goods that contain fat are likely to have partially hydrogenated fat, because it has a longer shelf life.A well-rounded diet based on the USDA guidelines should deliver sufficient amounts of all the essential vitamins and minerals. Adolescents tend to most often fall short of their daily quotas of calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamin D. Unless blood tests and a pediatrician's evaluation reveal a specific deficiency, it's preferable to obtain nutrients from food instead of from dietary supplements.   This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.

As teens become more independent in their food choices, they sometimes enjoy indulging in some not-so-healthy options. And if their friends have similar eating habits, they may underestimate how bad their diets really are because it seems normal to eat hot dogs and cookies for lunch.

Here are the four worst food habits teens have and what parents can do to help change them.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, as many as 20% to 30% of teens do not eat breakfast on a regular basis.﻿﻿ Eating breakfast can upstart your teen's metabolism, which helps with weight control, mood, and school performance.

Parents can play a big role and try to change this behavior. You can ensure that your teen eats a healthy breakfast by making the foods readily accessible to him. Make it a part of your routine to put breakfast on the table and sit with your teen while you both enjoy a healthy breakfast. Or, if time is a problem, look for quick and healthy breakfast options that are perfect for on-the-go meals.

In the food pyramid, the ""other"" food group is the smallest section at the top. It is filled with foods that are supposed to be the least amount of servings in a daily diet. This category includes foods teens tend to gravitate towards, including high fat and calorie-laden snack foods. Quite often, eating too much from this food group doesn't allow enough healthy foods into their diet.

Help your teen break this habit by having fruits and healthy snacks available. Try to avoid having too many high fat and calorie snacks in the kitchen as well. It is easier to grab a bag of chips than it is to pick up fruit that needs to be washed and peeled. Yet, if fewer or those ""other"" foods are around and you set a good example for your own snack choices, your teen can eventually change their ways, too.

Teens hit fast food restaurants much more often than they did when they were younger. This is often because their school, sports, and work schedules overlap with regular meal times.

To circumvent this bad habit, talk to your teen about only eating fast food once a week. Then make dinner and healthy food available to her when she has the time. This is as easy as fixing an extra plate and allowing her to heat it up when she gets home from sports practice or whatever activity she enjoys.

A study looking at American youths aged 6 to 17 found an increase in the prevalence of soft drink consumption from 37 percent in 1978 to 56 percent in 1998.﻿﻿ Though these number declined between 2000 and 2010, sugary beverages remain a favorite among teens.﻿﻿ They are also one of the primary causes of obesity and are certainly not the healthiest beverage choice your teen can make.

You can help your teen choose a healthier drink by having fruit juice and water available and not buying soda. You can also try to keep fruit-flavored carbonated water on hand. These are a low-sugar alternative that still offers a hint of flavor and sweetness and teens really enjoy them once they give it a chance.

One common denominator for getting teens to eat healthier and avoid these bad food habits is your active role in providing healthy foods. If you can get in the habit of making these foods more readily available to your teen, you will see a change in their eating habits. You can also set an example for your own food choices. In the end, your entire family can enjoy eating healthier.

258,https://www.supersavvyme.co.uk/health/healthy-eating/nutrition-for-girls-over-10-and-teens,"It’s a common myth that getting fit is only about eating healthy and exercising. In reality, creating a healthy lifestyle and maintaining it isn’t about just those two factors—it’s also about being able to keep a positive attitude, strong mental health and a healthy self-image. Although there is a ton of advice out there on how to achieve a healthy lifestyle, here are some key factors to keep in mind:
1.	Drink more water. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.
2.	Get enough sleep. When you don’t sleep, You tend to eat more. Usually only junk food.
3.	Exercise. Not just a few times a week, but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially increase your life span.
4.	Eat more fruits and vegetables. All fruits and vegetables carry vitamins and minerals, components essential to your health. It’s suggested that we consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to maintain health.
5.	Eat the rainbow. Pick brightly-colored foods in the produce aisle. These are high in antioxidants (antioxidants remove free radicals in our body that damage our cells) and make a more appealing plate. Here are a few examples to look out for:
•	White (Bananas, Mushrooms)
•	Yellow (Pineapples, Mangoes)
•	Orange (Oranges, Papayas)
•	Red (Apples, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelons)
•	Green (Guavas, Avocados, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Celery)
•	Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplants, Prunes)
6.	Cut down on processed foods. Processed foods are simply not good for you. Most nutritional value is lost in the making of processed foods and the added preservatives are bad for our health. These foods contain a high amount of salt, which leads to high blood pressure and heart disease. In general, the more ingredients on the label, the more processed the item.
7.	Avoid negative people in your life. A positive mentality is key for a healthy life. You don’t need negativity in your life. If you feel that a person or friend is negative, just let him or her go.
8.	Avoid negativity within yourself. You don’t need negativity from yourself, either. Let go of all negative thoughts within yourself. Overeating tends to happen when one feels unhappy, so by staying in a positive state of mind, you cut out an unhealthy dependence on food to be happy.
9.	Avoid trigger foods. These are foods you can’t put down after one bite. Everyone’s trigger foods are different, but typically they consist of candy bars, chocolate, chips, cookies, or anything with high levels of refined sugar, salt, fat or flour.
10.	 Take your time eating. Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Don’t rely on a clean plate to tell you when it’s time to stop eating.
11.	 Prepare your meals. When you prepare meals yourself, you control exactly what goes in to them. This makes it easier for you to make the right healthy choices for your body.
12.	 Move toward low calorie and low fat alternatives. There are many low-fat or non-fat alternatives readily available in all grocery stores. Try switching your full-fat pantry staples for low-fat versions over a period of time.
13.	 Stop smoking. Smoking is bad, period. If you’re a smoker, quit for better health—not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. If you don’t smoke, stay that way.
14.	 Have healthy snacks on hand. Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the right things is what matters most. When turning to snacks during your day, look for things like fruit, salad, or freshly squeezed juices not from concentrate. These are nutritional and won’t give you a sugar crash.

If you are a teenager or parent of a teenager, then without a doubt, diet woes are a big part of your life. Teenage hormone rage, onset of puberty and mood swings make things even worse for them in their diet plan. Then there is the peer pressure to look thin and combined with all the anxiety of school work and the teen life, this can manifest into poor eating habits, eating disorders and other health problems. Here are a few tips for a healthy teen diet. Know your Calorie NeedsEvery body type is different and therefore food requirement for each individual is different as well. The daily calorie intake differs due to factors such as metabolic rate of the body, level of activities, age, physical health, emotional health etc. Teen diet plans must be made by taking into consideration each individuals unique needs. Due to puberty, some girls can have unexpected weight gain. This doesnt mean that they need to go on extreme dieting plan. In fact, this is the time when a teen body needs healthy meals to aid in the growth. Teenage boys have different energy needs than teen girls. Those who play sports might need more calories. Teen girls also have to eat foods rich in iron to compensate for the blood loss during their menstrual period. Eat well and healthy for a teenage diet that will help you lose weight if you need to and maintain your weight if that is your plan. Eat your BreakfastMissing out on fueling the body with healthy foods is not doing teens any favors in the diet department. A healthy diet for a teenager must include balanced meals during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Teens might be under the impression that skipping meals especially breakfast might lead to some weight loss. But doing so will only make you crave foods rich in fats and carbohydrates later in the day, and you might actually end up eating more than you might have if you had eaten a healthy breakfast. Good diets for teens mean a balance of nutrient-rich foods in every meal. Gorge on Fruits and VegetablesTeenagers might gawk at the word gorge used for vegetables but yes, this is possible with some creative tweaks even if you dont like your veggies raw. But more importantly, if you are sincere about losing that extra weight or even maintaining your svelte figure then fruits and vegetables should be a part of your healthy eating plan. This can be best diet for teens  way better than skipping meals. Go Easy on Refined FoodsPart of losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight for life is to eat everything in moderation. This helps in eliminating any cravings that might derail your healthy eating habits. Portion control is something that can help teens to eat healthy later in their life as well. Sugary sodas and refined flour treats such as cookies, burgers, pizza and buns sure feel good but they pack in empty calories and the refined sugar not only converts to fats but also harms the teeth. Shop TogetherA good idea to spend some quality family time is, go on parents-kids grocery shopping trips once in a while. Teens can check the labels on the food items; make their own food selection and learn to stock healthy foods. For those parents who are looking for easy diets for teens this can be an ideal time to learn about your teenagers food likes and dislikes and educate them and yourself about healthy food choices and gradually bring about a lifestyle shift.  More  Women who are able to plan their births are better able to complete their education, participate more fully and productively in the labour force, accumulate higher household savings, and raise healthier and better educated children. These family-level benefits accrue at the community and national levels as well, spurring economic development and growth.Show More Related Topics

260,https://rallycenteret.dk/Healthy-Diet-Plan-For-Teenage-Girl-To-Gain-Weight_183843/,"It’s a common myth that getting fit is only about eating healthy and exercising. In reality, creating a healthy lifestyle and maintaining it isn’t about just those two factors—it’s also about being able to keep a positive attitude, strong mental health and a healthy self-image. Although there is a ton of advice out there on how to achieve a healthy lifestyle, here are some key factors to keep in mind:
1.	Drink more water. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.
2.	Get enough sleep. When you don’t sleep, You tend to eat more. Usually only junk food.
3.	Exercise. Not just a few times a week, but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially increase your life span.
4.	Eat more fruits and vegetables. All fruits and vegetables carry vitamins and minerals, components essential to your health. It’s suggested that we consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to maintain health.
5.	Eat the rainbow. Pick brightly-colored foods in the produce aisle. These are high in antioxidants (antioxidants remove free radicals in our body that damage our cells) and make a more appealing plate. Here are a few examples to look out for:
•	White (Bananas, Mushrooms)
•	Yellow (Pineapples, Mangoes)
•	Orange (Oranges, Papayas)
•	Red (Apples, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelons)
•	Green (Guavas, Avocados, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Celery)
•	Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplants, Prunes)
6.	Cut down on processed foods. Processed foods are simply not good for you. Most nutritional value is lost in the making of processed foods and the added preservatives are bad for our health. These foods contain a high amount of salt, which leads to high blood pressure and heart disease. In general, the more ingredients on the label, the more processed the item.
7.	Avoid negative people in your life. A positive mentality is key for a healthy life. You don’t need negativity in your life. If you feel that a person or friend is negative, just let him or her go.
8.	Avoid negativity within yourself. You don’t need negativity from yourself, either. Let go of all negative thoughts within yourself. Overeating tends to happen when one feels unhappy, so by staying in a positive state of mind, you cut out an unhealthy dependence on food to be happy.
9.	Avoid trigger foods. These are foods you can’t put down after one bite. Everyone’s trigger foods are different, but typically they consist of candy bars, chocolate, chips, cookies, or anything with high levels of refined sugar, salt, fat or flour.
10.	 Take your time eating. Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Don’t rely on a clean plate to tell you when it’s time to stop eating.
11.	 Prepare your meals. When you prepare meals yourself, you control exactly what goes in to them. This makes it easier for you to make the right healthy choices for your body.
12.	 Move toward low calorie and low fat alternatives. There are many low-fat or non-fat alternatives readily available in all grocery stores. Try switching your full-fat pantry staples for low-fat versions over a period of time.
13.	 Stop smoking. Smoking is bad, period. If you’re a smoker, quit for better health—not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. If you don’t smoke, stay that way.
14.	 Have healthy snacks on hand. Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the right things is what matters most. When turning to snacks during your day, look for things like fruit, salad, or freshly squeezed juices not from concentrate. These are nutritional and won’t give you a sugar crash.

262,https://naturalsuperkids.com/nutrition-for-teenagers-tips/,"Feeding a teenager can be a real challenge at the best of times. There is an increased need for optimal nutrition for teenagers, but they just want to eat junk food with their friends! This can make it tough to find a balance that everyone is happy with.If this is something you’ve been struggling with, don’t worry. There are plenty of small tweaks you can make to the family’s diet to feed your teenager and help them thrive during their adolescent years.Watch the video below or keep watching to learn more about nutrition for teenagers and teenagers.﻿﻿We know that teens have unique nutritional needs because of the growth and development that occurs. Thanks to the increased requirement for nutrition, their appetite often increases as well! It can be impossible to feed them enough food, especially in the case of boys.Unfortunately, teenagers do tend more towards processed snacks and fast food. In fact, adolescents are the greatest consumers of calorie-dense junk foods! In some cases, this can be a bit of a rebellion, especially if you’ve raised them on a wholefood diet. But it is also because they need extra calories, so the brain looks for foods that are energy-dense.Most energy-dense foods don’t have the nutrients that a teenager needs. If your teen does tend more towards processed foods, you may want to talk to them about the difference between energy-dense foods and nutrient-dense foods.Even if they know that junk food isn’t great for them, it is difficult for them to resist it. The teenage brain is wired to be attracted to short-term rewards including junk food, screens and social media. This is because they have a higher amount of dopamine receptors.The pre-frontal cortex – where behaviour and decisions are controlled – isn’t fully mature until our early 20s, so teens are wired to prioritise reward over sensible behaviour! In this way, the decisions they make around junk food is quite normal from a developmental standpoint.Although it can be challenging to feed your teenagers well, it’s not impossible. There are a few key areas to focus on when it comes to nutrition for teenagers. These will not only help your teens as they grow and develop, but also will help keep the peace at home!Protein is important throughout the lifespan. But because of the growth and development that teens undergo, it’s particularly important for them to get enough. Protein is also a nutrient that fills kids up – if they don’t get enough, they’ll be constantly hungry!Protein includes sources such as:Don’t save protein as something just for dinnertime! Make sure they are including some protein at each meal, and within their snacks as well. You can get them to add some nuts and seeds to their breakfast, or add some shredded chicken to their lunchtime wrap.Many teens don’t get enough fibre because they prefer processed and refined carbohydrates. But we want to focus on getting plenty of fibre into their diet.Fibre helps to keep them full, but it’s also an important part of healthy digestion and detoxification. It fuels a healthy microbiome, which helps with balancing hormones and preventing hormone-related skin issues. This can be a great motivator for teens to eat fibre, especially if they have skin issues!Good sources of fibre include:It’s easier to add these types of foods into meals and snacks that your teens already like. For example, you might add some extra veggies into a pasta sauce or add some lentils into taco mince.Most teens get plenty of carbohydrates – but not necessarily the healthiest form! Teens will usually eat refined and simple carbs such as bread, pasta, rice, crackers and snacks. But this is not what their bodies need!When we eat refined carbohydrates, we’ll feel good for a little bit as our blood sugar levels spike. But within an hour or so, they will crash back down and leave us feeling ravenous again. This is very much the case when it comes to teens as well!On the other hand, when we eat complex high-fibre carbohydrates, the energy feeds slowly into the body. This keeps us fuller for longer, and also steadies out mood.Complex carbohydrates include wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and legumes. By switching some of these into the diet of your teen, you’ll help keep hunger at bay and hopefully avoid a few mood swings as well!During adolescence, there are significant developments in the brain that we need to support. That’s why it’s important for teens to eat the right type of fats, particularly omega-3s.Omega-3 fatty acids are one of the most essential nutrients for the brain and nervous system. They are also important for a steady mood, healthy skin and balanced hormones.The only consistent way to get omega-3s through the diet is fish and seafood. Some nuts and seeds have a small amount of omega-3s, but they need to be converted in the body before they can be used.When it comes to fish and seafood, get a little creative with how you serve it. Fresh is best, but even tinned fish like salmon, sardines and mackerel are good options. You can make salmon mornay, make some fish patties, or even serve up some calamari or squid. Ideally, your family would be including 3-4 serves of fish and seafood per week – but one is better than none at all!If your teen doesn’t like fish or is vegetarian, you may want to look at sourcing a high-quality omega-3 supplement.All of the vitamins and minerals are important throughout every stage of life. But when it comes to nutrition for teenagers, there are four minerals that need particular attention.Teens need more calcium than the average adult. In fact, they need around 1200-1300mg per day – the same amount as a pregnant woman! This is due to the bone development that occurs during adolescence.This amount of calcium is easy enough to get if your teen is eating 3-4 serves of dairy per day. But dairy can be a problem for some teens that react to dairy – including those with an allergy or intolerance. That’s why we want to consider other forms of calcium.Some dairy-free sources of calcium include:To learn more about dairy-free sources of calcium, check out our previous article here.Another key nutrient is magnesium. It plays hundreds of roles throughout the body, but one of the most essential is energy production. Magnesium helps to produce energy on a cellular level. As many teens are tired and lethargic, getting enough magnesium can be useful to support energy production.It also aids in a healthy stress response, can be beneficial for anxiety, and is needed for healthy hormone production.Magnesium can be found in foods such as:However, it can be difficult to get enough magnesium through diet alone. Many teens will benefit from taking a high-quality magnesium supplement, especially if they tend towards high stress, anxiety and low energy levels.We often think about iron for girls because of menstruation, which starts in the tween and teen years. But iron is also critical for all teenagers – boys and girls, menstruating or not. Because of the intensive growth that happens during adolescence, teens experience an increase in blood volume. This requires extra iron.However, iron is particularly important for teenage girls, especially if they experience heavier periods. Teenage girls are also more likely to become vegetarian or not eat meat, which can make it difficult to get enough iron into them. In this case, a supplement may be warranted.Red meat is the top source for iron, although you can get it through green leafy vegetables and legumes as well.Iron is the easiest nutrient to keep an eye on, as all you need is a simple blood test to check for a deficiency. If your teen is showing signs of low iron such as low energy, pale skin and fatigue after exercise, it’s worth getting a check-up.Zinc is essential for so many factors during adolescence. We need zinc for growth and development, reproductive maturation during puberty, brain health and skin health.Zinc is also essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. If your teen tends to get sick easily, it’s worth keeping an eye on their zinc intake.You can find zinc in:When it comes to zinc, you want to keep a particular eye on their intake if they are vegetarian or don’t eat much meat. Although zinc is found in some plant-based foods, the levels are on the lower side. This makes it difficult to get enough of in a vegetarian diet. If your teen is vegetarian or dislikes animal proteins, a supplement may be required.It’s common for parents to be hard on themselves when their teens are no longer under their control! But we want to make sure that we keep the conversation open with our teens so that they don’t feel like they need to hide things from us. It’s natural for us to lose some control.So when it comes to nutrition for your teen, do the best with what you can do at home. Don’t worry too much about what they eat when they’re around their friends or go out for social occasions.Stay aware of what they eat, and educate them about why they might want to make healthier choices. That’s all we can really do! Need some personalised advice when it comes to nutrition for teenagers?

Australian teenagers are not meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations or physical activity guidelines and have high free sugar intakes with three-quarters of 9-13 and 14-18 year olds consuming more than 10% of their energy intake from free sugars (exceeding the WHO recommendation). As nutrient requirements during adolescence are high to fuel rapid growth and development, it is essential that teenagers are eating a well balanced diet.Teenagers require sufficient energy and nutrient intakes to achieve normal growth and development. Adolescents have higher requirements for calcium than adults (up to the age of 51 years) and need additional kilojoules to support the adolescent growth spurt. Results from the 2011-2012 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) show teenagers are not meeting recommended dietary intakes (RDI’s) for calcium and vitamin A. Girls also have intakes of iron and magnesium below RDI levels.  Both boys and girls have sodium intakes higher than the upper limit of intake as well as excessive sugar intakes. The highest 10% of 14-18 year olds were deriving at least 23% of their energy from free sugars.Results from the NNPAS also show that teenagers and young adults consume more soft drinks, burgers and chips than any other age group while only 15.6% of adolescents consume eggs and egg dishes on any given day. One serve* of eggs provides teenagers with 239µg of vitamin A (27-34% RDI), 97µg of folate (24% RDI), 43µg of iodine (29% RDI), 0.5mg zinc (4-7% RDI), 208mg phosphorus (17% RDI), 1.7mg of iron (11-15% RDI), 0.8µg of vitamin D (16% RDI) and 2.4mg of vitamin E (24-30% RDI). Due to the wide range of nutrients found in eggs, they may therefore play a useful role in meeting the nutritional requirements of teenagers.The NNPAS also showed 41 percent of teenagers energy intake comes from discretionary foods, the highest percentage of all age groups. These foods are  low in nutritional quality such as sweet biscuits, cakes, pastries, processed meats, savoury pastries and pies and commercial fried foods. High intakes of discretionary foods may displace more nutritious foods in the diet, in turn leading to lower than ideal intakes for many nutrients. The Australian Health Survey indicates that around 85% of teenagers do not meet the guideline for daily vegetable intake while just over half consume two or more serves of fruit daily. Eggs are a nutrient-rich food and may therefore have a useful role to play as a nutritious snack food for teenagers.The 2010 NSW Schools Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (SPANS) indicates that between 30-40% of secondary school students skip breakfast. Research shows breakfast eaters are more able to control their weight, have better nutrient intakes, better concentration levels and are better able to perform mental tasks throughout the morning. In particular, a low glycemic index (GI) breakfast has been shown to benefit cognitive performance in adolescence more than those who consume a high GI breakfast or skip breakfast. Australian teenagers who skip breakfast are more likely to have lower intakes of key nutrients such as thiamin, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium and iron, with breakfast eaters tending to have a healthier diet overall.Improving teenage breakfast eating habits is therefore important to ensure good health, optimal mental and physical performance and for long-term establishment of healthy eating habits that may assist weight control. Eggs have been shown to have a greater satiety index than ready-to-eat breakfast cereals or white bread, and when eaten for breakfast, eggs can reduce the amount of energy (kilojoules) consumed at lunch by 29%. A 2013 study in adolescents who frequently skipped breakfast found the consumption of a higher protein egg-rich breakfast assisted appetite control and prevented snacking later in the day.Research has also shown that eating a variety of foods at breakfast is associated with better mental performance in adolescence. Other breakfast research specific to adolescents showed those consuming breakfast felt more alert, satiated and content compared to those who did not consume breakfast and that they were generally at an advantage in terms of cognitive performance during the school morning. Furthermore, a recent study has linked poor breakfast eating habits at 16 years of age with an increased likelihood of developing the metabolic syndrome or having particular components of the metabolic syndrome including central obesity and high fasting blood glucose at 43 years of age.Another research  study in overweight or obese adolescent girls who skip breakfast  indicated that  a high protein (35g) breakfast including eggs causes the greatest reduction in food cravings and increase in brain reward signalling compared to a ‘normal’ protein (13g) breakfast. The high protein breakfast also reduced daily ghrelin (hunger hormone) and increased daily peptide YY (satiety hormone) levels compared to having no breakfast. A high protein breakfast also reduced evening snacking of high-fat foods compared with breakfast skipping. As eggs provide a wide range of different nutrients including protein and numerous vitamins and minerals, they can make a significant contribution to teenagers’ diets.The level of overweight and obesity in Australian teenagers remains high, due to declining levels of physical activity, more screen time and dietary changes with time. Current figures show 25.7% of adolescents aged 12-17 years are overweight or obese,  with more boys being  overweight than girls. Being overweight or obese substantially increases the risk of acute health problems and chronic disease. Overweight and obese teenagers are more likely to have risk factors for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease than those who are not overweight. Similarly, an Australian study among 14 year olds concluded that based on blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol levels and anthropometric measures, almost a third of the teenagers showed physical signs that raise their risk of developing heart disease later in life. Studies from overseas also suggest being overweight or obese during adolescence can lead to emotional and behavioural difficulties.Eggs are a highly nutritious food and are relatively low in kilojoules, with one serve* providing 581 kilojoules. As eggs are rich in protein, they may also increase satiety therefore contributing to a greater ability to manage total food intake over the day. For further details on eggs and obesity, refer to ENAG’s Eggs and Obesity statement.Some evidence suggests higher protein, low glycemic load diets can improve symptoms of acne that is common in teenagers. As a protein-rich food, eggs lower the glycaemic load of the diet and could therefore play a role in the treatment and prevention of acne.    Overall, eggs are a highly nutritious food that can play an important role in the diet of teenagers. Eggs are recommended as part of a healthy eating pattern that also includes adequate amounts of wholegrain breads and cereals, fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy foods, lean meat, fish and poultry and unsaturated fats.This statement is for healthcare professionals only.*One serve = 2x60g eggs (104g edible portion)For consumer-friendly information about feeding eggs to babies and children click here.Australian Health Survey: http://www.abs.gov.au/australianhealthsurvey New recipes and news in your inbox every month!

264,https://shelfcooking.com/food-for-teenagers/,"Stop the madness of your teens eating you out of house and home! We've got some great tips on food for teenagers comin' atcha that will make meal planning a breeze and won't break the budget. Get excited!It's no joke that teens are ravenous! Sometimes it feels like they literally don't stop eating. Like, ever. Do they have hollow legs or something?!? And when they have friends over, you can forget about having any food left in the fridge, freezer, and pantry…*Note: When you click the links in this post, we may receive a commission at no extra cost to you. …Or so you thought! Feeding your teenager doesn't have to be stressful or super expensive! Start meal planning and stick to our go-to food for teenagers, and you'll really see some major differences in your grocery budget. But before we get to those, let's first go over…Because you're already feeding your teenager, you might as well involve them in the kitchen! Meal planning and cooking are important life skills every functioning adult needs to know. Whether your teen is going to be out on their own soon or they've still got a few more years at home, it's always a good idea for them to help out.Meal planning with your teen is also a great way to spend some quality time together. Uninterrupted time, away from phones, tv, and technology? Yes, please! We also fully believe that meal planning and cooking together is a team effort. It shouldn't all rest on just one person's shoulders. Everybody has to eat, after all.One of the biggest reasons you should teach your teen how to meal plan? It trains them to eat healthier food at home versus going out to eat. The sooner they learn how to cook, how to meal prep, how to plan in advance for meals all on a budget, the better! We're not just talking dinner, either. This goes for breakfast and lunch as well!This is a great tip for everybody, not just teens! Most people don't drink enough water during the day. Surprisingly enough, your body may actually be thirsty when you think it's telling you it's hungry! So, when the hunger pangs strike, drink some water before reaching for the food.And if they're still starving? No problem. At least they got some much-needed water in them before they fill up on food!Yes, there is such a thing! Not only are these some great ideas to feed those ravenous teens, but they're also a good idea for any time you've got a lot of people to feed. We're all about sticking to that grocery budget, after all!Make meat a sidekick, not the main show stopper! Instead of serving everybody an entire chicken breast, you can chop it up and make it into a casserole where it's mixed in with other filling ingredients, such as rice, cheese, and veggies. You can do this with pretty much any meat that you have! Rice bowls, quesadillas, enchiladas, pasta dishes, and soups are all great ways to do incorporate proteins. When your teens reach for a snack, make sure they're grabbing something that'll actually fill them up. Sure, those fruit leathers or candy bars are tasty, but the second they're done with them, they'll want more. The same goes for meals! We love cereal in our house, but it's a snack, not a breakfast. Here are some of our favorite ways to stretch a meal and satisfy those ever hungry teens:Teach teens about healthy, cheap, and filling foods, and have them start by eating those first. We're definitely not anti-sweet treats in our house! But they know which foods for teenagers to reach for when they're starving.Sure, the boxed or frozen foods from the store are easy to grab and whip up in a snap at home. But they're crazy expensive! Teach kids how to make their own and they'll really benefit from it in the long run. Not only will they save money, but it'll be healthier since you can choose the ingredients they're using.Here are just a few of our favorite homemade food for teenagers:These are all so easy to make! Do your teens have favorites? If so, they can make food ahead on the weekends. This way they can grab and go during the week when they're busy.Extracurricular activities make dinnertime challenging, especially if you have multiple teens and kids who all need to be in different places on different days. However, feeding them doesn't have to be hard! Try out these ideas and be amazed at how much easier it is to feed your busy kids. It's also much cheaper to skip the drive-through!Pro Tip: If you're sending food in a thermos that you don't want to get soggy, like chicken nuggets, then add a paper towel to the bottom before adding the food in. This should soak up any wetness that accumulates and will keep the food nice and ready to go.Whew, well there you have it! Our top food for teenagers to help fill them up while keeping the grocery budget down. We hope this helps you out! What's your teen's favorite foods that don't break the budget? Share them in the comments so we can all get some great ideas!Looking for more great ideas?Have fun, and keep raising those capable kids/teens!

A healthy diet needs to meet the changing nutritional needs of a growing teen and importantly, helps prepare them for a lifetime of healthy eating behaviours.Teens have unique needs
These years are a critical period of growth and development, so good nutrition is essential. During adolescence, the need for most nutrients including energy, protein, vitamins and minerals increases. Appetite often increases, so it’s key to have plenty of healthy foods on offer. As teens gain more independence, it can also be tempting to eat more energy dense snack foods and fast foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt and low in other more important nutrients.Choosing a healthy diet during teen yearsThe best way to make sure teens are getting all of the nutrients they need, its best to eat mainly from the core food groups:Body image – a key concern for teensDuring adolescence, teenagers grow and develop at different rates and it is sometimes difficult to accept these changes. Some teenagers develop unrealistic expectations about how their body should look and may need some professional help with this.Being overweight or underweight can be a concern during adolescence. A healthy diet will meet nutrition needs without providing too much or too little energy (kilojoules). Following fad diets, or eliminating whole food groups to lose weight is not recommended and can be dangerous.Make eating as a family a priorityEvidence has shown that adolescents who frequently eat together with at least one other family member have a healthier diet. Eating with family has also been linked with a reduced risk for overweight and obesity. Also, sharing and making family meals a priority, having a more structured mealtime environment and creating a positive family meal atmosphere are all linked with lower rates of disordered eating in adolescents, particularly young women.Take a family approach to cooking and healthy eating. Choosing and enjoying a diet that includes a variety of foods from each food group, coupled with regular physical activity will help teenagers to grow, develop and live a healthy life.An Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD) can provide nutrition and dietary advice to make sure teenagers are meeting their nutritional needs. They can also work with teenagers to improve body image and self-esteem.",6.4775,10,2.34,9.29,4.28,367

A Victoria's Secret Model Made Me Love My Stretch Marks!Trying to lose weight doesn't mean you have to be miserable with an overly strict diet and cut out the things you love. It just takes moderation. You need to eat properly and take in all the minerals, proteins, and vitamins you need. There is a trick that helps you eat in moderation without feeling like you're on a diet or doing anything too strictly. That is to eat smaller portions throughout the day. So instead of 2 big unhealthy meals, have more meals throughout the day that are small in potion and try to keep them healthy. Stop trying to lose weight and you actually will...I know you've heard this before but really sleep can make such a difference with your energy, which can affect how you eat, snack, and your motivation towards exercise.

You can go running after school with a friend. You can take up a class together, so many people love kickboxing. You can go swimming, you can even do rock climbing and tennis. Whatever you enjoy the most. Staying active also helps reduce anxiety and stress, which could promote weight gain. When you start to eat more slowly, you will give your body the time it needs to get signals that you're full. That way you don't eat over what your body needs and what you feel like. We shouldn't feel too heavy after a meal, it just should feel like you have more space for another piece. Chips, fast food, and things with a lot of sugar in them can cause weight gain. Try to avoid them on a regular basis and switch them out for healthier alternatives that you enjoy as well. And of course, we don't need to stress how important drinking lots of water is and how much it can help you stay healthier and reduce the unhealthy snacking urge. You can even spice it up by adding lemons or fruits to give it flavor. Main Image Credits: Instagram @moveactiveLove yourself enough to live a healthy lifestyle! Check out our Health & Fitness section here.

The first time she watched ""The Devil Wears Prada"" around the age of 12, Farida felt something that she couldn’t quite explain at that time. She was inspired. The clothes, the hair, the makeup and of course, Paris. It made her feel ecstatic; wanting to jump years ahead to enter the industry in a way or another. She is a makeup fanatic and spends 80% of her time looking at new products, and putting them on her wishlist. She studied multimedia journalism, and wanted to further utilize it by writing about her passion. Farida loves to take time for herself and unwinds by watching ""Friends"" and doing her skincare routine before bedtime.

268,https://www.additudemag.com/win-the-food-fight/,"Fajitas…for breakfast? This plan finds creative ways to introduce nutrition — and bend the rules to fit in healthy food choices around medication side effects.When teens with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) are left to eat on their own terms, they often don’t figure out what makes food choices healthy. They may spend lunch period talking with friends or forget to come home at dinnertime. And when they do sit down at the table, they don’t stay there for long. What’s more, stimulant medications used to treat ADHD can cause appetite loss, and without internal cues to eat, she will forget to do so — not a good thing, considering the fact that individuals with ADHD tend to burn more calories than their non-hyperactive counterparts.So what are some tips for healthy eating for teens with ADHD? Here are some ideas that may help you:Fajitas for breakfast? Cereal for dinner? Why not? Teens with ADHD need to eat food that’s interesting to them at the moment. If your teen takes medication, he will want an after-school snack and a before-bed snack. Forget the bromide about “spoiling their supper.” Get food into them when the opportunity arises.Pay attention to your teen’s medication schedule, particularly because ADHD medication can suppress appetite. Make sure snacks and meals are available during those hunger dips. You might consider changing the timing of meals to coincide with appetite spurts. Load up on calories at breakfast, before the medication kicks in.Teens with ADHD have special nutritional needs. Studies show that protein can increase focus and sustain concentration. Adequate levels of omega-3 fatty acids can also improve the functioning of the ADHD brain. Try adding protein, along with fruits and vegetables, to their favorite flavored smoothie or soup. Liquid meals can be consumed quickly, which suits the tempo of hyperactive teens.[Free Guide: Managing Symptoms with Food]Set out “grazing food” around the house, wherever he spends the most time — near the TV, in the basement, where he might take his private phone calls. Energy bars or packets of nuts or trail mix are good choices. Keep a supply of grab-and-go foods in the fridge: wraps with his favorite fillings, string cheese, and celery sticks with peanut butter.Buy packages or boxes of snacks and put his name on them. Pack “his” foods in your teen’s knapsack and car cup-holder. Give her her own jar of peanut butter to keep in her room. As midnight snacks go, it’s a good one — high in protein and good fats. Below are some other ADHD-friendly snacks:Energy bars: Clif Kid Organic Zbars (clifbar.com); LaraBar (larabar.com)Pretzels and crackers: Mary’s Gone Crackers (marysgonecrackers.com); Doctor Kracker (drkracker.com); Newman’s Own Organics pretzels (newmansown.com)Smoothies: Odwalla Soy Smart (odwalla.com); Naked Juice Superfood (nakedjuice.com)Sometimes the thought of sitting down for a meal seems too much for teens with ADHD. They have things to do, and eating isn’t necessarily one of them. I have found that teens like single-serving packages of crackers and nuts, and homemade snack foods I put in plastic baggies. Also, try serving meals on small plates. Dinner won’t seem so overwhelming, and they may eat something when they’re not feeling hungry.People with ADHD jump from one thought to the next, and when faced with a lot of options, a teen may decide to decide later — or not at all. Ask him to list his favorite foods, and slot them onto a weekly calendar that you keep on the fridge: oatmeal or scrambled eggs for breakfast, turkey wrap or vegetable soup for lunch, cheeseburger or strawberry smoothie for dinner. He can change it weekly, or until he gets tired of eating the same thing.[9 Breakfast Recipes You Can’t Afford to Skip]

While 2,000 calories per day is a good average for most teen girls between 13 and 18 years old, your teen might need more or less depending on her growth rate and how much she exercises. Ask her doctor to help you develop meals that will help her lose weight without compromising her health.The best -- and healthiest -- way for a teen girl to lose weight and keep it off is not to diet but to follow a balanced meal plan that is low in fat, sugar and sodium and rich in essential nutrients that will help her grow and develop. While 2,000 calories per day is a good average for most teen girls between 13 and 18 years old, your teen might need more or less depending on her growth rate and how much she exercises. Ask her doctor to help you develop meals that will help her lose weight without compromising her health.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, any healthy meal, including lunch, should consist of at least 50 percent produce. Lunch for an overweight teen girl could start with a salad of 1 cup of mixed, raw leafy greens like romaine, spinach or leaf lettuce topped with 1/2 cup of her favorite fresh or cooked vegetables, such as tomatoes, shredded carrots, cucumbers or mushrooms. She should use only a few teaspoons of a low-fat vinaigrette to keep her added fat intake below 6 teaspoons per day.A typical lunch for a teen girl on a 2,000-calorie diet could include approximately 2 1/2 ounces of a lean protein mixed along with her salad greens and vegetables. A 1-ounce serving of protein is equivalent to 1/4 cup of cooked beans or tofu, 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds, one whole egg or 1 ounce of cooked lean chicken, turkey, poultry, fish, shellfish or beef. Make sure that the protein she chooses is prepared with a low-fat method like grilling, roasting or steaming.A teen girl shouldn't avoid carbohydrate-rich grains in order to lose weight. She should have at least 3 ounces of grains per day, with half or more supplied by whole grains such as oatmeal, brown rice or bulgur. A healthy lunch can easily fulfill 2 ounces of this recommendation. Have her try adding 1 ounce of cooked whole-wheat pasta shapes to her salad and pairing the meal with a whole-grain bread roll.Teen girls need plenty of calcium, and low- or nonfat dairy products are a good way for them to get enough of the mineral without adding unnecessary calories into their diet. Her lunch could incorporate 1 1/2 ounces of shredded reduced-fat cheese sprinkled on top of her salad, or she could have 1 cup of low- or nonfat milk as her beverage. If she's a vegan, a strict vegetarian or lactose-intolerant, she can choose a calcium-fortified plant milk, juice or bread or get her daily calcium from soy or dark leafy greens.Instead of high-calorie cookies or cake, a teen girl can enjoy fresh fruit as a naturally sweet dessert along with her lunch. A typical lunch for a 2,000-calorie diet might include 1/2 cup of fruit, an amount she could supply with a 1/2-cup serving of sliced fresh fruit, 1/4 cup of dried fruit like raisins or apricots or a small piece of whole fruit. She should avoid fruit canned in heavy syrup and limit her consumption of 100 percent fruit juice, both of which contain more sugar than fresh fruit.ReferencesResourcesWriter BioMichelle Kerns writes for a variety of print and online publications and specializes in literature and science topics.

One thing is for sure, if you have a growing teenager, plan to have your grocery bill skyrocket.  They can eat a lot of food. On the opposite extreme, you may have a small-ish teen who doesn’t eat much at all. Whether they have hit a growth spurt, or their appetites is diminished, they can both eat the same healthy snacks!We’ve always seen snacking as a way to meet nutrient gaps from the day.  If the day is half gone and no protein has been consumed, I always suggest a snack higher in protein. If no fruits or veggies have been eaten, then I suggest one of those!The perfect snack to me, is one that has a little protein paired with some complex carbs.  These can not only  fill nutritional gaps in a teens diet, but they are also filling and satiating!  These are some of our favorite healthy snacks for teenagers:

273,https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/food-activity-and-sleep/healthy-weight/healthy-eating-teenagers,"It can be hard to change a bad eating habit. Start by working on the small things that are easier to change in order to maintain a healthy body weight.Don’t skip meals – eating regularly can help you eat less overall and avoid the urge for junk food.Have a good breakfast every day. Good breakfast choices include: whole-grain cereals, such as Weet-BixTM or porridge, whole-grain toast, eggs, fruit and low-fat milk (green or yellow top) and low-fat, low-sugar yoghurt.Make your lunch, and leave your wallet at home. This will help you stop buying unhealthy junk food at school or on the way there – plus it will save you money.If you are buying your lunch:Choose healthier options for snacks, such as fruit, low-fat, low-sugar yoghurt, home-made popcorn, nuts and hummus with crackers or vegetable sticks.Don’t be fooled in to thinking that all snack bars are healthy. Many can be high in sugar and fat. Think of them as special treats. And when you are looking to buy one, study the nutrition labels on the back of the packet and look for the bar with the lowest sugar and fat content per 100 g, or the best Health Star rating (the most stars).Fuel up on vegetables and fruit – aim to eat vegetables at least 3 times a day and fruit at least 2 times a day. It’s easy if you include them in each meal and in your snacks.Eat a meal prepared at home before going out with your mates so that you’re not tempted to waste lots of money on junk food.Have a go at cooking for yourself and your whānau – they’ll love it, and you’ll learn some great skills for when you leave home.Watching TV while eating dinner can increase the amount you eat. Switch off the TV, your computer, tablet and cell phone while you’re eating dinner so you aren’t distracted.Eat meals together as a family or household as much as possible.Drink tap water or low-fat milk rather than soft drinks, energy drinks, cordials or sports drinks (even after you’ve been running around the sports field or killing it at the gym, water is still best). Even 100% fruit juice has a lot of sugar in it.Avoid alcohol. There are lots of good reasons to avoid alcohol – the main one is that it is just not that healthy for you.Think before you buy. Ask yourself, are you really hungry, or are you actually thirsty, tired, bored, feeling a bit down or stressed, or are you just buying it because your friends are?Avoid fad diets – anything that suggests you cut a whole food group/type (eg, carbohydrates, fat) from your diet is most likely to be a fad diet. Those diets are often not nutritionally balanced. This means that you could miss out on important vitamins and minerals that your body needs.Page last updated: 31 July 2018",7.0275,9.68,6.05,9.38,3,481
274,https://www.cookinglight.com/eating-smart/nutrition-101/how-to-talk-to-teen-losing-weight,"Here's how to help them—without hurting their self-image. A few weeks ago Weight Watchers announced free summer memberships to teenagers—a move that was met with backlash by many dietitians and eating disorder specialists. Recent research supports most of the outrage expressed by health professionals, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advocates against diets or calorie restriction for children and teens due to their ineffectiveness and increased risk of developing unhealthy eating habits.    But the flip side is that many parents with overweight kids are now more confused than ever. What are the “right” ways to talk to your teen about weight loss—and how do you help them without hurting their feelings or self-image? Research suggests these are the most effective things parents can do.When talking to your teen, there’s a big difference between healthy and harmful conversations. Research suggests it’s essential that parents make health the focus—not weight or appearance. Parents should also be aware of the way they talk about their own bodies and appearance. Instead, focus on health, health improvements, and the positives that come from adopting those—like more energy, increased strength or stamina, better sleep, or meeting a physical activity goal.Why: Bringing up a teen’s weight or a perceived need to lose weight is often interpreted as something is “wrong” with them, and the suggestion of dieting by a parent appears to have no positive impact on weight loss. In fact, some studies correlate it with weight gain in teens. Furthermore, conversations between parents and teens that focused on weight or appearance (instead of healthy eating habits) were associated with a greater risk of the teen developing unhealthy eating habits.Calorie restriction isn’t effective for adults so why should we expect it to work for teens? New research suggests it’s more important to focus on food quality than counting calories, and the best way to do this is to encourage small gradual changes to food intake and activity.Experiment with recipes, try new foods, and involve family members in cooking and meal planning. Find activities that are enjoyable, and encourage them because they’re fun and make the body feel better. Our bodies were designed to move every day to stay healthy—not for the sole purpose of losing weight.     Why: Not only is dieting ineffective, but the American Academy of Pediatrics shared several studies in their 2016 Clinical Report in which teen dieting (focused on calorie restriction) was associated with weight gain—not loss—as well as the development of disordered eating habits.The Washington Post sums the scenario up well with a quote from Sandra Aamondt, neuroscientist and author of Why Diets Make Us Fat: “It’s crazy as a society that we have chosen to focus on weight loss rather than improving fitness and nutrition, which are easier and more important.”Restricting food or putting certain foods “off-limits” for the purpose of weight loss is never a good idea, but especially when it comes to kids and teens. While it is the parents responsibility to limit unhealthy foods and set an example of healthy eating, this doesn’t mean policing intake—which often ends up being counter-productive. Instead, support your teen by making healthy food options readily available and modeling healthy eating behaviors.  Why: Numerous studies suggest negative effects on health and on a child’s relationships with food when parents restrict food or pressure kids to eat certain foods. A 2014 study looking at teen weight practices suggests that parental food restriction contributes to disordered eating habits, as well as weight gain—not weight loss.Before you start overhauling your child’s health, consider what example you’re setting for them. Parents ultimately lay the groundwork for kids’ and teens’ lifestyle habits. Even though they may seem to pay little attention to parents’ activities, kids will adopt the behaviors they’ve seen parents and caregivers model.  Why: A 2011 study suggested that the adoption of healthy eating and activity habits by parents had the greatest influence on teens’ weight and lifestyle habits—even when compared to parents and teens making changes together. To take a little pressure off parents, remember that the goal in modeling health behaviors isn’t perfection. Instead, it’s about balance.Gone are the days of “diet foods” or special weight loss meals and shakes. All foods fit into a healthy diet (yes, even the occasional piece of cake!), and it’s recommended that every member of the family make smart food choices and get regular activity—no matter their age or weight status.Why: Singling out family members isn’t effective or supportive, but a family approach to healthy living is productive. A 2014 article in Today’s Dietitian cites several studies that suggest that getting the whole family involved is much more effective than focusing on just the teen or parents.     Tired, full of energy, content, bloated—help teens connect what their bodies are feeling to what they’ve eaten (or not eaten) to encourage them to start listening to their bodies more. When I teach childhood nutrition, I like to mention how we’re all born listening to our bodies: Infants eat when hungry (or cry to let someone know they’re hungry) and stop eating when they’re full. They don’t keep eating because there’s still milk in the bottle. But most of us lose touch with this as we adopt society’s expected meal times or we’re inundated with food availability and distractions.Why: Connecting the scientific relationship between foods and the body takes the emotions out of eating. This is the basis for intuitive eating, a non-diet approach to improving health that’s not only associated with positive health outcomes, but also improved self-image, decreased use of unhealthy eating habits, and improved physical fitness.The Bottom Line: Parents play a key role in supporting healthy lifestyle changes and should expect improvements to be gradual. Try to keep an open line of communication with your teen, be ready to listen, and connect them with resources that provide accurate nutrition information (like a dietitian) when they want to learn more.  ",6.4825,9.4,3.51,9.35,3.67,978
275,https://wakemedvoices.com/2019/10/a-healthy-weight-and-body-image-for-teenage-girls/,"As a parent, you may be noticing unhealthy changes in your teenage daughter’s weight and you worry about the effects on her health and body image.  While your daughter might feel upset or worried about her weight, it’s important for parents to address it but in a sensitive way that focuses on your teenage daughter’s overall health.Here are some helpful tips to get started:#1 – Focus On a Positive Body ImageIt’s so important that your teenage girl know that you love them unconditionally regardless of their body size. Comment on your teen’s strengths and positive qualities regularly.  ‘No one’s body is perfect but yours is perfect for you. You are enough just as you are.’#2 – Role Model for Your TeenOne of the best ways parents can help set their teenage girl up for healthy habits early on is to model these behaviors themselves. If we are expecting the teen to limit their sodas or chips, then try not to keep these tempting snacks in the house for the whole family.  Instead, set aside a time to go out once a week to enjoy a treat such as ice cream.  Healthy dietary habits modeled in the home have been shown to persist when children move out.#3 – Encourage Small ChangesSuddenly removing all sweets, demanding 2-hour jogs, and taking away phone privileges will backfire and set your teen up for failure. Start with simple changes – ones that she can complete and feel good about. When she succeeds with small steps, she’ll build her self-confidence and stay motivated.#4 – Don’t Micro-ManageIf you comment on every food choice, your teen is likely to get angry and withdraw. You’ll also damage her confidence in her own decision-making. Continue to provide a variety of healthy options.Review these healthy lifestyle basics with your teens by “counting down”:5 – Aim for 2 fruit and 3 vegetables a day.  If this seems impossible, start with something more realistic like eating 1 more fruit a day.  Make this easy by providing cut up vegetables with hummus or apples with peanut butter in the fridge.3 – Aim for three balanced meals a day including a high protein breakfast.2 – Limit screen time to 2 hours a day.1 – Aim for 1 hour of physical activity daily.  Start with doing family activities together, find a walking trail to explore or activities the teen enjoys.0 – Limit sugary drinks like juice and sodas.  Drink more water or low-fat milk.For more healthy meal ideas, visit the WakeMed Energize Pinterest page here.If you or your teen is concerned about their weight or related medical conditions, The Pediatric Weight Management Program can be a great resource for your family, with locations in Raleigh, Apex, and Clayton.Together, a multidisciplinary team consisting of pediatric obesity specialists, dietitians, an exercise specialist and a pediatric psychologist work with your family to create a personalized treatment plan to improve lifestyle behaviors and weight related medical conditions for your teen.

276,https://www.gracepointwellness.org/1342-child-development-parenting-adolescence-12-24/article/45509-teenage-caloric-requirements," Adult Crisis: (813)272-2958Children's Crisis: (813)272-2882Outpatient: (813)272-2244It can be extremely difficult for teens to sort through conflicting messages about food and eating, and to resist the unhealthy food temptations that bombard people on a daily basis. Portions served at restaurants have ballooned, as have the size, number, and quantity of pre-packaged foods. Hundreds of sugary, caffeinated, and colorful drinks make ordinary water seem bland. As well, processed, unhealthy foods with little nutritional value and dangerously high levels of sodium and unhealthy fats are much more affordable and more convenient to prepare than fresh produce, whole grains, lean meats, and other ""whole"" foods. Furthermore, because families' schedules are so busy and rushed, they often do not have a lot of time to cook or to prepare healthful meals and instead turn to fast food or other prepackaged heat-and-eat options. Despite these challenges it is critical that teens learn to make healthy decisions for themselves because diet and nutrition are key ingredients to life-long health. Adolescence is the last opportunity for parents to influence the development of healthy eating habits that will benefit their children for the rest of their lives.Despite the abundant supply of food many countries, most adolescents do not receive adequate nutrition at a time when their bodies' growth and development is accelerating. In general, adolescent diets include too much fat, sugar, caffeine, and sodium and not enough nutrient-dense foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables and calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Furthermore, their diets lack an adequate amount of fiber. In addition to these problems of what to eat, and what not to eat, many teens also struggle with how much to eat. While some teens eat more calories in a day than their bodies require and subsequently become obese, other teens obsess about gaining weight and battle negative body image causing these teens to overly restrict their food intake and become dangerously underweight.During the teen years, youth have much more control over their eating habits and diets, than they did in their younger years. Teens often eat most of their food outside of their home, whether it is lunch in the school cafeteria, snacks at friends' houses, or pizza after the school basketball game. Nonetheless, parents are still able to positively influence their teens' food choices and foster healthy eating habits. In order for this to occur, parents must be somewhat knowledgeable about the dietary requirements for growing adolescents and understand their basic nutritional needs. Second, parents can become healthy role models for their youth who learn a great deal more by observing others, than from long and lengthy lectures about the virtues of a good diet. Third, parents can foster and promote their teens' ability to make wise and healthy food choices by providing some structure in the home to facilitate these learning opportunities.We will begin by providing parents some basic information about the caloric requirements for adolescents. But because all calories are not equal, we will then review the basic nutritional guidelines for adolescents as suggested by American Dietetic Association and the Food and Nutrition Information Center at the United States Department of Agriculture. Finally, we will provide some practical suggestions that will enable parents to assist their teens to make healthy food choices. Teenage caloric requirementsA good starting point for any healthy diet is an understanding of how much food to eat; i.e., the caloric requirements a body needs to grow and develop without becoming underweight, or overweight. Caloric requirements vary according to age, sex, activity level, and genetics that establish the body's metabolism (the rate at which the body burns calories). In general, guys need to eat more than girls during adolescence, and more active youth need to eat more than less active youth. As well, adolescents' caloric needs can fluctuate daily depending on youths' changing activity levels. For the purpose of this article, teens who get less than 30 minutes of vigorous exercise in a day are considered sedentary. Teens who exercise 30 to 60 minutes a day are considered moderately active. Teens are considered active when they get more than an hour of exercise each day.For adolescent males, the daily number of calories required for optimal health gradually increases by about 200 calories every one-two years during early adolescence, then will peak during middle adolescence, and then will decrease by approximately 200 calories in late adolescence. In general, sedentary 12-year-old males need about 1800 calories each day. Sedentary males' daily recommended caloric intake peaks at 2600 calories around age 19-20 years old. Then, it decreases to 2400 calories a day from ages 21 through 24 years. However, moderately active teen boys between the ages of 12-13 years need about 2200 calories per day. That need peaks at 2800 calories per day from around age 16 and remains at that level for the remainder of adolescence, if the youth continues to exercise at those levels. Active teen guys have significantly larger daily calorie requirements. At age 12, active boys need about 2400 calories a day to stay healthy. That need increases by 200 calories each year the youth ages, and the daily calorie requirement peaks at 3200 calories between the ages of 16 and 18 years old. However, young men in late adolescence still need about 3000 calories per day as long as they stay physically active at these levels.APPROXIMATE CALORIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ADOLESCENT MALES: All things being equal, the daily caloric requirements for adolescent females are noticeably lower than for their male counterparts. Furthermore as girls mature, their caloric requirements remain relatively stable relative to boys. For example, sedentary teen girls around the ages of 12-13 years need about 1600 calories per day, and their daily calorie requirement reaches the highest level around age 19 years at 2000 calories. As long as they remain sedentary, that requirement will stay the same through the rest of adolescence and into adulthood. When teen ladies are moderately active, they need about 2000 calories every day from ages 12 through 18 years. That need only slightly increases to 2200 calories everyday for the rest of adolescence. Active teen girls need about 2200 calories per day when they are 12-13 years old, and that daily need rises to 2400 calories from ages 14 through 24 years.APPROXIMATE CALORIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ADOLESCENT FEMALES:  << PreviousAdolescent Parenting IntroductionNext >>Nutritional Guidelines for Teens5707 N. 22nd StreetTampa, FL 33610P: (813)272-2244F: (813)272-3766About Us | About CenterSite | Terms & PrivacyCopyright © CenterSite, LLC, 1995-2021",6.275,9.45,3.02,9.14,3.49,1073
277,https://www.quora.com/How-did-you-lose-weight-as-a-teenager,"It’s a common myth that getting fit is only about eating healthy and exercising. In reality, creating a healthy lifestyle and maintaining it isn’t about just those two factors—it’s also about being able to keep a positive attitude, strong mental health and a healthy self-image. Although there is a ton of advice out there on how to achieve a healthy lifestyle, here are some key factors to keep in mind:
1.	Drink more water. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.
2.	Get enough sleep. When you don’t sleep, You tend to eat more. Usually only junk food.
3.	Exercise. Not just a few times a week, but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially increase your life span.
4.	Eat more fruits and vegetables. All fruits and vegetables carry vitamins and minerals, components essential to your health. It’s suggested that we consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to maintain health.
5.	Eat the rainbow. Pick brightly-colored foods in the produce aisle. These are high in antioxidants (antioxidants remove free radicals in our body that damage our cells) and make a more appealing plate. Here are a few examples to look out for:
•	White (Bananas, Mushrooms)
•	Yellow (Pineapples, Mangoes)
•	Orange (Oranges, Papayas)
•	Red (Apples, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelons)
•	Green (Guavas, Avocados, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Celery)
•	Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplants, Prunes)
6.	Cut down on processed foods. Processed foods are simply not good for you. Most nutritional value is lost in the making of processed foods and the added preservatives are bad for our health. These foods contain a high amount of salt, which leads to high blood pressure and heart disease. In general, the more ingredients on the label, the more processed the item.
7.	Avoid negative people in your life. A positive mentality is key for a healthy life. You don’t need negativity in your life. If you feel that a person or friend is negative, just let him or her go.
8.	Avoid negativity within yourself. You don’t need negativity from yourself, either. Let go of all negative thoughts within yourself. Overeating tends to happen when one feels unhappy, so by staying in a positive state of mind, you cut out an unhealthy dependence on food to be happy.
9.	Avoid trigger foods. These are foods you can’t put down after one bite. Everyone’s trigger foods are different, but typically they consist of candy bars, chocolate, chips, cookies, or anything with high levels of refined sugar, salt, fat or flour.
10.	 Take your time eating. Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Don’t rely on a clean plate to tell you when it’s time to stop eating.
11.	 Prepare your meals. When you prepare meals yourself, you control exactly what goes in to them. This makes it easier for you to make the right healthy choices for your body.
12.	 Move toward low calorie and low fat alternatives. There are many low-fat or non-fat alternatives readily available in all grocery stores. Try switching your full-fat pantry staples for low-fat versions over a period of time.
13.	 Stop smoking. Smoking is bad, period. If you’re a smoker, quit for better health—not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. If you don’t smoke, stay that way.
14.	 Have healthy snacks on hand. Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the right things is what matters most. When turning to snacks during your day, look for things like fruit, salad, or freshly squeezed juices not from concentrate. These are nutritional and won’t give you a sugar crash.

Recipes  Advice  All Nutritionist Cindy Williams has help for parents of active kids with high energy needs — and hollow legs!“Help — my teenager has developed hollow legs and my grocery bill has tripled!” For parents of teenagers this is a common cry, and even more so if your teenager is involved in lots of sport and physical activity. On top of that parents are often so busy being taxi drivers that there is hardly time to prepare nutritious and filling meals.You can blame your depleted pantry on hormones. During adolescence the hormones are raging, pumping out large amounts of testosterone, as well as other hormones, that trigger cells all over the body to grow. Your child is ‘shooting up’, starting with their hands and feet — hence the frequent trips to buy larger shoes. The peak ‘growth spurt’ usually occurs in girls around ages 12 to 13 while in boys it’s a little later at 14 to 15. Over four years a boy can grow 30cm, put on six kilos of muscle and increase his heart muscle by 40 per cent. All this growth requires energy in the form of lots of food.Sporty teenagers especially need carbohydrates (to provide energy for growth and sport), protein (for satiety and to help muscles grow and repair after a training session), and plenty of water to keep well hydrated. If they eat a variety of nutritious foods including lean meat, chicken, fish, beans and lentils, nuts, dairy foods, fruit and vegetables and wholegrain breads and cereals they will obtain all the nutrients they need. However, there are a couple of nutrients that need special attention during the teenage years:Rapidly growing teenagers need to eat iron-rich foods for energy, growth and a strong immune system. Growth, sport (especially endurance running) and menstruation in girls all increase iron needs. A teenage boy needs more iron than a younger boy or a man. Red meat is the best source of iron (although mussels are also great with just five mussels providing as much iron as a large rump steak). It is much more difficult for vegetarians to obtain enough iron and without careful planning, this could impair sports performance.Calcium is also important for teenagers. Adolescence is the ‘window of opportunity’ when calcium is easily laid down in the rapidly growing bones. Both weight-bearing exercise and eating calcium-rich foods builds strong bones.The Australian Institute of Sport says that ‘skipping a meal is like skipping a training session.’ Sporty teenagers need to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner plus nutritious snacks to support their training, and to provide enough energy and nutrients for their rapid growth. Eating small frequent meals makes it less likely they will feel over-full, nauseous or sluggish during training.Sometimes kids are so busy or tired or distracted that they can’t be bothered eating or preparing their own snacks. Even if they say they are not hungry just put a small plate of food in front of them and they will most likely eat something. If you are concerned that your teen may not be getting all the nutrients and energy he or she needs, see a specialist sports dietitian for a personalised plan.Doing plenty of exercise will not impair teenage growth. In fact exercise builds muscle, bone and cartilage setting teenagers up for a healthy adulthood with less risk of osteoporosis and arthritis. High impact exercise during childhood actually increases cartilage in the knees making them stronger. But even good things taken in excess can cause problems. Your teenager’s sports coaches should be ensuring that there is adequate recovery time between training sessions.Teenagers can obtain all their nutrient requirements through real food. They do not need protein powders or nutrition supplements as ‘insurance’. In fact some supplements may hinder performance. Supplements should only be taken on the advice of a sports dietitian or doctor.If training sessions are less than 60 minutes or not high intensity, water is sufficient. Sports drinks are useful for high-intensity exercise of 60 minutes or more. They contain small amounts of carbohydrate and sodium and are especially designed to enhance fluid absorption. They can be drunk in the hour before, or during a high intensity training session for a quick energy boost and to promote hydration. Look for a sports drink that has four to eight per cent carbohydrate and 23-46mg sodium per 100ml.When it seems that however much your sporty teenager eats they never gain weight it can be tempting to think they can get away with eating fatty, salty, sugary snacks. But cakes, biscuits, chocolate, chips and soft drinks just aren’t satisfying or nutritious enough for growing teenagers. For peak health and sports performance they need to be eating the type of carbohydrate foods that provide extra nutrients such as wholegrain cereals, bread, rice, pasta, noodles, potatoes, corn, baked beans and fruit.Eat a light snack about an hour before exercise such as:Eat within 30-60 minutes of finishing your training session. This is the ‘window of opportunity’ to take in enough carbohydrate to refuel energy (glycogen) stores; protein to build strength and repair muscles and damaged cells; and fluids to rehydrate. The after-sport meal is especially important if your next training is within eight hours eg. after school on the same day. Here are some good choices:Generally food eaten two or fewer hours before exercise needs to be low in fat and fibre so it can more quickly digest and move out of the stomach. Experiment with the timing and type of food eaten before sport to see what works best. People vary in the amount and type of food they can cope with.Remember the one hour window of opportunity — eat a protein and carbohydrate-rich snack if you won’t be eating dinner within the hour.If you are working all day and ferrying kids to sport all evening you may not have time to prepare dinner before your ravenous teen arrives home.Sport is generally a great way for teenagers to develop a good relationship with their changing bodies. However, some teenagers can become self conscious and obsessively worried about gaining fat (usually girls) or not gaining enough muscle (usually boys). Here are some unhealthy behaviours to watch out for:active teens, sporty teens, teenagersThis site complies with the

281,https://www.thenationshealth.org/content/45/10/36,"Advanced SearchThe road to good health in adulthood is paved with the decisions made during the teenage years. And as teen girls and boys continue to grow, there are daily nutrients and habits they’ll need to keep them happy and healthy.“(In) the transition from the childhood to the teen years, nutritional needs increase with the rapid physical growth that occurs during those years,” says APHA member Nicole Larson, PhD, MPH, RDN, a National Institutes of Health-funded researcher and senior research associate at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health. “So there’s an increase in energy demands, but it’s also important to think about increases in nutrient demands.”Photo by PeopleImages, courtesy of iStockphoto.Teens need a variety of nutrients, such as iron, calcium, folic acid and protein, which can be found in lean meats, whole grains, low-fat dairy foods, fruits and vegetables, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion.Iron is essential for teens, but especially for teen girls, as they’ll lose more of it after starting menstruation, Larson says. Good sources of iron include meat, fish, poultry, green leafy vegetables, nuts and seeds, she says.“Another group of nutrients that’s important to be seeking out daily for bone health is calcium and vitamin D,” Larson says. “And good sources of these nutrients are low-fat milk, other dairy foods and dark green vegetables, along with fortified foods like fortified juice and cereal.”While foods and beverages high in calories, saturated fats, sodium and sugar aren’t off limits, teens should aim to eat those foods only on occasion, according to USDA. Consuming such foods and beverages on a regular basis can have long-term health consequences into adulthood, Larson says. And skipping out on nutrients such as iron could lead to fatigue or anemia.“You might tend to carry those eating behaviors with you over time,” Larson says. “And if you do not eat well over the adult years as well, there’s certainly an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, Type 2 diabetes and (being) overweight.”Good nutrition for teens starts at home. Larson says parents who want their teens to practice better nutrition should make healthy food readily accessible.Keep portable foods high in calcium and vitamin D, such as yogurt and lower fat string cheese, in the fridge for teens. Low-fat granola bars and whole-grain crackers are an easy way for teens to get their fix of iron and whole grains, Larson says. Produce such as pre-washed carrots or sliced apples are also good on the go.Parents should also encourage teens to eat breakfast before school and to pack their lunch during the school week, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Parents of teens should try to schedule family meals, as research shows teens who eat with their parents tend to have healthier diets, Larson says.“While that is not always possible, we know from research that teens really do appreciate having family meals, even though they’re often very busy,” Larson says. “But that is something that they enjoy. If it doesn’t work to meet up at dinner for a meal, try to be creative in terms of scheduling. Maybe it works better to have breakfast meals together or have lunch together on the weekends.”When teens are out in restaurants, tips include ordering milk instead of soda and a side dish of fruit over something high in calories, such as French fries. Teens should also look for smaller portions to avoid excess calories, she says.“Maybe it’s easier to order off the kids’ menu than the regular menu to make sure you’re getting a smaller portion and look for key words that indicate a healthier version of a sandwich or a menu item, like choosing a grilled chicken sandwich instead of a crispy chicken sandwich,” Larson says.When it comes to exactly how much produce, dairy and whole grains teens should eat, the needs vary between teen girls and boys. According to USDA, teen girls need four servings of vegetables a day, versus five servings a day for teen boys. Teen girls also need three servings of fruit daily versus four for teen boys. However, both need three servings a day of dairy such as cheese, milk or yogurt.The Nutrition Facts label is also a useful tool in figuring out how much food counts toward the daily value of calories, vitamins and more.

283,https://developingminds.net.au/blog/2016/6/14/teenage-girls-eating-and-weight-why-we-cant-leave-it-in-entirely-up-to-them,"Helping kids & teens feel calm, confident, cooperative and cope with challenges.Articles, ideas and help from a child/adolescent psychologist in Adelaide.  Let me tell you about Cindy. Cindy is the representation of many, many teenage girls I have seen over the last 20 years.  She is 14 and and very self-conscious.  She is desperate for approval by her peers and struggles with anxiety and confidence. One day, Cindy looks at herself in the mirror and decides she is fat.  Cindy is not fat.  But she weighs herself and is shocked to find she weighs much more than she did when she last weight herself when she was 10.  She starts to try to lose weight.  She skips some meals.  She tells people she isn't hungry.  She does 100 push ups at night in her room.  She cuts her portion sizes down to tiny amounts.   She weighs herself several times a day.Cindy loses some weight and is thrilled by this.  The weight loss gives her a sense of power and reward which is very seductive.  So she tries to lose some more weight - and then some more.  Her parents start to notice her weight loss and reduced eating, and are concerned by it - but they don't feel they can do anything - after all Cindy still eats.  In fact she still eats junk food.  Her weight loss is small. She is only *just* in the underweight category for her BMI.  They don't feel it is their job to question her - or to ""force"" her to eat more.  After all, she is old enough to make her own eating and exercise decisions.  Isn't she?Now let me tell you about Jenny.  Jenny is the representation of many, many teen girls I have seen over the last 20 years.  Jenny is also 14, also self conscious and also desperate for approval, and struggling with anxiety and confidence.  Jenny also feels she is fat.But Jenny doesn't skip meals.  Instead Jenny starts eating more food.  Feeling depressed and miserable, eating is her only solace.  She begs her parents to buy her junk food at every opportunity and they do.  Jenny stops playing sport because she is too self conscious to be in gym clothes.  Jenny looks for the block of chocolate in the cupboard and eats it in one sitting.  Jenny refuses to go for walks with her family. She spends most of her time sitting in front of the computer. She starts putting on weight.  Which makes Jenny more depressed, and more likely to binge eat and more likely to avoid exercise.Her parents notice, and are concerned - but they don't feel they can do anything - after all, Jenny is not significantly overweight.  They don't want to make her feel worse.  They don't feel it is their job to question her - or to ""force"" her to exercise or eat more healthy food.  After all, she is old enough to make her own eating and exercise decisions.  Isn't she?Unfortunately what I know about Cindy and Jenny is that they are standing on the edge of a metaphorical cliff. They are both at significantly high risk of the mental health problems including even more severe depression, anxiety and eating disorders.   This happens to boys too - and increasingly so in my experience.In order to prevent them falling off this cliff,  adults need to step in.  Cindy needs to stop weighing herself, reduce her exercise and be required to increase her nutritional intake - whether she wants to or not. Jenny needs to increase her nutritional intake, have her junk food limited and be required to have a more active lifestyle - whether she wants to or not. None of these things are easy.  In fact it is one of the difficult jobs adults and parents will face.  But they are absolutely necessary for these girl's emotional health.The reality is that 14 year olds are simply not old enough to make every final decision about how much and what they eat, and exercise.  This is especially true for 14 year olds who have or are at risk of a mental health disorder as are Cindy and Jenny.If you are concerned about your teenagers eating and health decisions, contact your GP, click here to find out more about our services or contact the Butterfly Foundation. When life sucks for teens has a chapter on ""I hate the way I look"" which is suitable for teens who are self conscious about their appearance. Click here to read more When you sign up, we'll email you 6 vital tips for helping teens when they seem sad or depressed AND 10 essential ideas for praising and thanking kids.© Kirrilie Smout 2020, All Rights Reserved.",7.2675,10,6.89,9.17,3.01,782

285,https://www.beeflambnz.co.nz/iron-deficiency-teenage-girls,"HOME > NUTRITION > FACTS & ADVICE > IRON DEFICIENCY IN TEENAGE GIRLSThe symptoms of iron deficiency are subtle and can be mistaken for a ‘busy lifestyle’. If you have any of these symptoms, you may be low in iron and should see your doctor:Tiredness (even after rest)Lack of energyPoor concentrationIrritabilityFrequent infectionsIf you’re a young female, pregnant or breastfeeding, you may be at risk of iron deficiency. Women have increased requirements for iron due to:Monthly blood loss associated with heavy periodsSupport baby growth in pregnancy and during breastfeedingLow meat intake, in particular low red meat intakeTeen girls and young women are some of the most vulnerable groups when it comes to iron deficiency and this is undoubtedly having an impact on their performance at school. Over 40% of respondents to a 2018 iron deficiency survey aimed at young women stated they had issues with their concentration, whilst 14% admitted they were having to take days off ‘all the time’. Iron is used by the body to carry oxygen in the blood. Iron is important for:Energy – iron is essential for producing energy from foodBrain function – iron carries oxygen to the brain to help us concentrate and learnTo fight infection – the immune system depends on iron to work properly, so if you are low in iron, you may be more prone to infectionsHealthy growth and development – in babies, toddlers and childrenA wide variety of foods contain iron, however foods high in iron are not necessarily absorbed by the body in the same way.Iron found in beef, lamb, pork, chicken and fish (haem iron) is well absorbed by the body. Comparatively, the iron found in cereals with added iron, tofu, spinach, eggs and legumes (non-heam iron) is less well absorbed by the body.The best sources or iron are beef and lamb as they are high in well absorbed iron. Eating an iron-rich diet which includes up to 500g of cooked red meat weekly is recommended in the New Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines.Eat iron-rich foods, including beef and lamb 3 to 4 times a weekMaximise iron absorption from plant based foods (e.g.cereals with added iron, tofu, spinach, eggs, legumes) by combining them with either vitamin-C rich foods (e.g. orange, strawberries, tomato, broccoli) or foods containing haem iron (e.g. beef, lamb)If you drink tea, coffee or cola, have them between meals as they decrease the amount of iron absorbed from the meal.Learn more about boosting your iron here.

Worldwide shippingCatherine RussellOctober 17, 2017Teen girls going through puberty and growth spurts require nutrients for energy, growth and physical and emotional health. In fact, teenagers have the highest nutrient needs of any age group:Teenage girls need 1,800 to 2,200 calories a day if they're ages 11 to 13, and 1,800 to 2,400 calories a day if they're ages 14 to 18. – eatright.orgToo often, body image issues lead to unhealthy choices, such as a refusal to eat foods they think are ""fatty"" but that actually contain good fats like omega-3 and monounsaturated fats,"" says Janice Newell Bissex, author of The Moms' Guide to Meal Makeovers.But not all calories are not created equal. A bag of chips and a chef's salad may have the same calories, but their nutrients can be distinctly different. If your teen daughter is a picky eater, or struggles with body image issues, getting her to choose healthy food options can be a struggle. Here are seven healthy eating tips to encourage good food habits in teenage girls:Teens are notorious for bad eating habits – and teenage girls even more so. Good nutrition during the teen years is crucial for girls to prevent disease, develop healthy food habits, and fuel their minds and bodies. #YouGoGirl! Catherine Russell is Būband's Content Manager

288,https://www.cdc.gov/scienceambassador/documents/healthy-eating-pa.pdf,"It’s a common myth that getting fit is only about eating healthy and exercising. In reality, creating a healthy lifestyle and maintaining it isn’t about just those two factors—it’s also about being able to keep a positive attitude, strong mental health and a healthy self-image. Although there is a ton of advice out there on how to achieve a healthy lifestyle, here are some key factors to keep in mind:
1.	Drink more water. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.
2.	Get enough sleep. When you don’t sleep, You tend to eat more. Usually only junk food.
3.	Exercise. Not just a few times a week, but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially increase your life span.
4.	Eat more fruits and vegetables. All fruits and vegetables carry vitamins and minerals, components essential to your health. It’s suggested that we consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to maintain health.
5.	Eat the rainbow. Pick brightly-colored foods in the produce aisle. These are high in antioxidants (antioxidants remove free radicals in our body that damage our cells) and make a more appealing plate. Here are a few examples to look out for:
•	White (Bananas, Mushrooms)
•	Yellow (Pineapples, Mangoes)
•	Orange (Oranges, Papayas)
•	Red (Apples, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelons)
•	Green (Guavas, Avocados, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Celery)
•	Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplants, Prunes)
6.	Cut down on processed foods. Processed foods are simply not good for you. Most nutritional value is lost in the making of processed foods and the added preservatives are bad for our health. These foods contain a high amount of salt, which leads to high blood pressure and heart disease. In general, the more ingredients on the label, the more processed the item.
7.	Avoid negative people in your life. A positive mentality is key for a healthy life. You don’t need negativity in your life. If you feel that a person or friend is negative, just let him or her go.
8.	Avoid negativity within yourself. You don’t need negativity from yourself, either. Let go of all negative thoughts within yourself. Overeating tends to happen when one feels unhappy, so by staying in a positive state of mind, you cut out an unhealthy dependence on food to be happy.
9.	Avoid trigger foods. These are foods you can’t put down after one bite. Everyone’s trigger foods are different, but typically they consist of candy bars, chocolate, chips, cookies, or anything with high levels of refined sugar, salt, fat or flour.
10.	 Take your time eating. Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Don’t rely on a clean plate to tell you when it’s time to stop eating.
11.	 Prepare your meals. When you prepare meals yourself, you control exactly what goes in to them. This makes it easier for you to make the right healthy choices for your body.
12.	 Move toward low calorie and low fat alternatives. There are many low-fat or non-fat alternatives readily available in all grocery stores. Try switching your full-fat pantry staples for low-fat versions over a period of time.
13.	 Stop smoking. Smoking is bad, period. If you’re a smoker, quit for better health—not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. If you don’t smoke, stay that way.
14.	 Have healthy snacks on hand. Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the right things is what matters most. When turning to snacks during your day, look for things like fruit, salad, or freshly squeezed juices not from concentrate. These are nutritional and won’t give you a sugar crash.

That's because most starchy carbohydrates, like bread, white rice, and potatoes, dissolve into glucose soon after you swallow them. Starting the day with eggs or another source of protein instead will not only help your child feel fuller, but it will help him lose weight.Dr. Ludwig is seriously worried about how many kids are getting fat -- the percentage of 6- to 11-year-olds who are overweight has doubled in the last 25 years. And the situation is only going to get worse: Children who are overweight are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, and could face kidney failure and amputations by age 30. Ironically, our focus on low-fat eating over the last decades -- and the subsequent boom in high-carb meals and snacks -- may be a key factor in the obesity epidemic, says Dr. Ludwig. But an Atkins-style low-carb diet isn't the answer either. In his eye-opening new book, Ending the Food Fight: Guide Your Child to a Healthy Weight in a Fast Food/Fake Food World, he offers a road map -- backed up by the latest scientific research -- for helping kids stay slim.The glycemic load is key. This is the measure of how quickly a food containing carbohydrates turns into glucose. Studies have shown that when a kid eats a high-glycemic meal, his blood-glucose surges and then plummets -- leaving him even hungrier. A low-glycemic meal takes longer to digest so a child's blood sugar stays steady, and he'll feel full longer. In general, low-glycemic carbs have more fiber and are less processed.Choose lots of veggies and fruits (but not all of them). No surprise here: You should pile on the produce. However, corn and potatoes have a high glycemic index, and certain tropical fruits, such as bananas and pineapple, are more likely to contribute to weight gain than apples, grapes, oranges, cantaloupe, kiwi, or berries.Try to include protein in most meals and snacks. In addition to being filling, protein stimulates the release of a hormone that helps the body release stored fat to use for energy, says Dr. Ludwig.Fat isn't always the enemy. Healthy fats like unsaturated oils, nut butters, and avocado slow down digestion, and they make fruit, veggies, and whole grains even more filling. Fat is actually vital to health: It's needed to make cell membranes throughout the body -- and the types of fat your child eats affect his immune system, nervous system, and overall health.Avoid foods that your great-grandparents couldn't have recognized. Fake foods (think chicken nuggets, fruit roll-ups, cheese puffs, and other highly processed products bearing no resemblance to anything found in nature) are rarely healthy choices, says Dr. Ludwig. When you choose grains, look for the least-processed options, such as stone-ground wheat bread, steel-cut oatmeal, and brown rice.Food can affect behavior, too. When your child's blood sugar drops soon after a high-glycemic meal, she also has a surge in the stress hormone adrenaline. That can make her cranky, irritable, or unable to focus in class.Kids don't have to feel deprived. No parent wants to put their child on a diet. But if the whole family focuses on low-glycemic eating, one child who has a weight problem won't feel singled out. By helping him focus on the quality of the food he's eating rather than the quantity, he can eat until he feels satisfied and still lose weight.

Most people have a misconception that a weight loss diet requires drastic diets such as intermittent fasting, 10 week diet, keto diet or health supplements such as medicines or pills. However, this is wrong. One requires a balanced diet with the right proportions of all food groups. More often than not, the food that person is accustomed to eating since birth is the best diet to lose weight instead of trying out different fancy foods. An Indian diet chart for weight loss in 7 days is very effective because Indian meals are very balanced as they include proteins, fats, carbohydrates and fibers in required proportion. There are some nutritious foods such as grains, lentils, healthy fats, vegetables, dairy and fruits. Since there are a number of ways to cook Indian food, healthier options can always be found.

Minor modifications can be made to this as per an individual’s taste. ‍‍While most people feel that having 5-6 meals in a day is a lot, your body actually finds it easier to consume the calories in 5-6 small meals as compared to 3 huge meals.

Remember that losing belly fat will take time. It can’t all disappear at once!What teens need are some healthy habits that they can incorporate into their lifestyles to see long-term results.Perseverance + Determination + Measuring A scientific study from Rush University Medical Center called The Science Behind Breakfast explained the benefits of eating breakfast every morning.One significant benefit is that breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, which automatically helps you burn more calories during the day.When you eat breakfast, you are letting your body know that there is plenty of food to eat.When you skip breakfast, your body gets the message that it needs to conserve energy instead of burning calories.Some examples of healthy breakfasts that you can eat are oatmeal with fruit and nuts, chia seed pudding, overnight oats, and smoothies.Teens are under a lot of stress today. Stress from homework, problems with friends or relationships, pressure from figuring out what to do in their future, and so much more.Stress increases your risk of obesity due to a stress hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is released when the body is under tremendous amounts of pressure, and it causes weight gain.Help your teen relax so they can lose more weight. Great ways to relax are to do yoga, go for a walk, read a book, or play a board game.Exercise is one of the best ways to burn fat and gain muscle. Muscle is fantastic because it boosts your metabolism, which will help you burn more calories throughout the day.Not only that, muscle takes more calories to maintain than fat does, even at a resting rate. A scientific study posted in Obesity, a Research Journal called  Neurobiology of Exercise, explained how exercise is one of the best ways to limit obesity.Some fun exercises to do are dancing, hiking, jogging, biking, jump rope, swimming, and strength training. The great thing is that all of these exercises can be done with friends!After a workout, you need a warm bath or sauna to help the metabolism process and lose weight faster!Teenagers are prone to drinking more sugary drinks than water. Whether it’s from the vending machines at school or the cafeteria, it’s not uncommon to see teenagers drinking copious amounts of pop.Sugary drinks are full of empty calories that contain no nutrition. To lose weight, teenagers should substitute those drinks for water instead.If plain water doesn’t taste good, try freshening it up and changing the flavor with some lemon and other fruit slices. Alternatively, teenagers can drink seltzer as well if they prefer.Foods that contain added sugar (processed food) are incredibly unhealthy for teens. Not only do they cause blood sugar spikes, but they also cause weight gain as well.Limiting the amount of unhealthy and processed foods that teens eat is a great way to lose weight.Foods such as candies, cookies, cakes, and other baked goods should be limited and replaced with foods that contain natural sugar, such as fruit.If you want to bake a healthy dessert for your teen, try using healthier foods to sweeten it, such as dates.Fiber is something that fills your body up and helps promote regular bowel movements. Fiber acts like a broom in your colon, helping to keep everything moving.An article in Science Daily called Soluble fiber strikes a blow to belly fat explained that the more grain you eat, the easier it will be to lose weight.The foods that have the most fiber in them are fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, and root vegetables. Nuts and seeds also contain high amounts of fiber.

A scientific study posted in the US National Library of Medicine called Television viewing and childhood obesity explained that watching television causes weight gain in three ways.These ways are the displacement of physical activity, increased calorie consumption while watching TV caused by snacking or the effects of advertising, and thirdly, reduced resting metabolism.Instead of watching TV, the best thing to do is something active. Even going for a walk around the block or going shopping with friends is better than watching TV.There are so many activities that teens can do, such as hiking, dancing, and more.The American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should watch no more than one to two hours of TV a day.Instead of watching TV — or other screen time with computers, cellphones, and video games — encourage your teen to read a book, work on an art project or listen to music and dance.Better yet, spend time with your child enjoying an active hobby such as gardening, flying kites, or hiking.Instead of eating three large meals a day, and that’s it, it’s better to eat three smaller meals a day with three healthy snacks.Eating more frequently throughout the day boosts your metabolism, which will help you burn more calories.One way to eat smaller meals is to put food on a lower plate or bowl, which will automatically make it seem like you are consuming more food even though it’s the same amount.Healthy snacks include apples, grapes, vegetables dipped in hummus, air-popped popcorn, or a handful of nuts.Having a support group is very important for teens. Losing weight is easier if you know that other people are trying to do the same thing you can bond with.A great way to get a support group is to join some fitness classes. Whether it be a dance class, a yoga class, or a spinning class, these are all great ways for teens to meet new people and form a support group.Search your area to see if there is a weight loss group or club for your teen to join.Not only will they meet new people and make new friends, but it will help keep them motivated and inspired and keep them on track.Restricting calories is something that many teens gravitate towards because that’s what they might see their friends doing, or they might think that’s the only way to lose weight.Teenagers should never eat less than 1200 calories a day for women, and for men, it’s a bit higher at 1800 calories a day.Once you go below this number, your body will go into starvation mode and hold onto all of the calories you eat instead of burning them.This is the exact opposite of what teens want, so they need to realize the consequences of severely restricting their calories. Severe calorie restriction can also lead to eating disorders.It’s straightforward to continue eating even after the point of fullness. This causes weight gain because you are consuming more calories than your body needs.To avoid eating past the point of fullness, try to eat slower and chew more. This will make it easier to sense when you are full compared to just shoveling food in quickly and only realizing how full you are after you finished eating.Losing weight can be tough to do on your own. It’s important to let your teen know that you are there to support them and help them.Help them make healthy choices by buying healthy food when you go grocery shopping and making healthy dinners and meals. If the kitchen is stocked with healthy foods, healthy foods are what your teen will eat.Make exercising fun for them by doing activities with them. Showing your support makes all the difference in their weight loss journey.I hope this article helped you. Unfortunately, there are tons of diet and fitness advice online that look like good advice but is sabotaging your weight loss for a particular reason.Drastically cutting calories to lose belly fat when you’re a teenage girl isn’t wise. It would help if you had optimal nutrients because your body and brain are still growing, and you’re building bone.Calories provide you with the energy to be alert and focused during school, too.Exercise and reducing empty-calorie foods, though, can help you lose weight all over, including your belly, while supporting a healthy lifestyle.One month isn’t enough time to notice dramatic changes in the size of your belly. But, it gives you enough time to see a 2- to 4-pound drop in your weight and jump-start a long-term slimming solution.Check with your doctor before starting any weight-loss program to determine a healthy goal for you.When you lose weight, you can’t target the body’s part from which the weight will come off. Weight loss generally occurs all over your body.Belly fat, however, is particularly responsive to traditional weight-loss measures — improved eating habits and exercise.The average teen girl burns between 1,800 and 2,400 calories daily, depending on her size and activity level. To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you consume.A teenage girl should cut out foods that don’t provide many minerals and vitamins, though, rather than trim portion sizes of healthy foods.The calories you eat should consist of fresh fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy.Foods high in sugar and refined grains are high in calories but not particularly filling, so they can make you overshoot your daily calorie intake and gain belly fat.Cookies, cupcakes, cereal bars, sweetened breakfast cereal, white bread, and white pasta are examples of foods that contribute to belly fat.Soda and other soft drinks, which contain a form of sugar known as fructose, have been shown to increase belly fat considerably when consumed as part of a regular diet, revealed a study published in a 2009 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation.Order a 32-ounce soda with your meal at any restaurant and consume 400 extra calories that provide no nutrition or qualities to make you feel full.Even 100-percent juice can cause you to exceed your daily calorie needs efficiently. Skip high-calorie drinks and choose water and a whole piece of fruit instead.You’ll benefit from the filling fiber that slows digestion and helps squelch your appetite.Exercise is critical when your intention is a fast reduction of belly fat. Moving more increases your calorie burn, which can help you lose weight, as long as you don’t increase your food intake.If P.E. isn’t your thing, that’s OK; you have lots of options for exercise. Take a walk after school with friends or family. Join a dance class or an extra-curricular sports team.Ride your bike, ask your parents to join the local fitness center, or turn on some tunes and move to your favorite songs in the privacy of your room.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends you get at least one hour of activity daily. Boost that recommendation by 30 minutes to get better belly-reducing results.Stress from school and social interactions can cause hormonal reactions in your body that cause you to store fat in your belly.A study published in a 2011 issue of Obesity showed that young girls who reported stress related to school events had the highest visceral, or belly, fat compared to less-stressed peers.Stress interferes with sleep, too little of which can increase your hunger hormones and negatively influence your food choices.You may overeat or seek out high-calorie comfort food when you feel overwhelmed or upset. Consider whether you put a lot of pressure on yourself to overachieve in school.Feelings of self-consciousness and peer pressure to be skinny can also contribute to stress.Managing stress is a life-long struggle, so keep your expectations reasonable, especially if your goal is one month.If you can take measures to reduce your anxieties, you’ll be taking steps that support your dietary and exercise strategies to reduce your belly fat over the long-term.

297,https://jillcastle.com/teenager-nutrition/7-ways-support-teen-growth-spurt/,"The key to shedding pounds is choosing foods that fight hunger.If your child had a bagel for breakfast this morning, it wasn't much more nutritious than eating a bowl of sugar, says Parents advisor David Ludwig, MD, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Boston Children's Hospital. That's because most starchy carbohydrates, like bread, white rice, and potatoes, dissolve into glucose soon after you swallow them. Starting the day with eggs or another source of protein instead will not only help your child feel fuller, but it will help him lose weight.Dr. Ludwig is seriously worried about how many kids are getting fat -- the percentage of 6- to 11-year-olds who are overweight has doubled in the last 25 years. And the situation is only going to get worse: Children who are overweight are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, and could face kidney failure and amputations by age 30. Ironically, our focus on low-fat eating over the last decades -- and the subsequent boom in high-carb meals and snacks -- may be a key factor in the obesity epidemic, says Dr. Ludwig. But an Atkins-style low-carb diet isn't the answer either. In his eye-opening new book, Ending the Food Fight: Guide Your Child to a Healthy Weight in a Fast Food/Fake Food World, he offers a road map -- backed up by the latest scientific research -- for helping kids stay slim.The glycemic load is key. This is the measure of how quickly a food containing carbohydrates turns into glucose. Studies have shown that when a kid eats a high-glycemic meal, his blood-glucose surges and then plummets -- leaving him even hungrier. A low-glycemic meal takes longer to digest so a child's blood sugar stays steady, and he'll feel full longer. In general, low-glycemic carbs have more fiber and are less processed.Choose lots of veggies and fruits (but not all of them). No surprise here: You should pile on the produce. However, corn and potatoes have a high glycemic index, and certain tropical fruits, such as bananas and pineapple, are more likely to contribute to weight gain than apples, grapes, oranges, cantaloupe, kiwi, or berries.Try to include protein in most meals and snacks. In addition to being filling, protein stimulates the release of a hormone that helps the body release stored fat to use for energy, says Dr. Ludwig.Fat isn't always the enemy. Healthy fats like unsaturated oils, nut butters, and avocado slow down digestion, and they make fruit, veggies, and whole grains even more filling. Fat is actually vital to health: It's needed to make cell membranes throughout the body -- and the types of fat your child eats affect his immune system, nervous system, and overall health.Avoid foods that your great-grandparents couldn't have recognized. Fake foods (think chicken nuggets, fruit roll-ups, cheese puffs, and other highly processed products bearing no resemblance to anything found in nature) are rarely healthy choices, says Dr. Ludwig. When you choose grains, look for the least-processed options, such as stone-ground wheat bread, steel-cut oatmeal, and brown rice.Food can affect behavior, too. When your child's blood sugar drops soon after a high-glycemic meal, she also has a surge in the stress hormone adrenaline. That can make her cranky, irritable, or unable to focus in class.Kids don't have to feel deprived. No parent wants to put their child on a diet. But if the whole family focuses on low-glycemic eating, one child who has a weight problem won't feel singled out. By helping him focus on the quality of the food he's eating rather than the quantity, he can eat until he feels satisfied and still lose weight. For more information, go to endingthefoodfight.com.Shift the balance to carbs with a low- or medium-glycemic load, and cut back on ones that are high. Some examples:Parents Magazine

COVID-19 and your child's mental health
Many families already know the importance of eating a healthy, balanced diet. But if your child or teen is an athlete performing at a high level on a regular basis, you may have additional concerns about their nutrition and dietary needs.Brittany Wehrle, a performance dietitian with the Children's Health℠ Andrews Institute Sports Performance powered by EXOS answers some of the most frequently asked questions about what young athletes should eat to power their performance.""There is no 'one-size-fits-all' plan when it comes to nutrition,"" explains Wehrle. ""Individual nutrient needs vary by sport, type, and intensity of the activity, age, body size, goals and training volume. Generally speaking, the more intense the activity and the more hours you train, the higher your carbohydrate and overall calorie needs will be.""Meeting with a Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics (CSSD) for a personalized consultation is the best way for young athletes to determine their specific, appropriate amount of calories and nutrients to eat each day.Depending on their goals, training status and type of activity, athletes need anywhere from ½ to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. A sports dietitian is the best resource to help you determine the right amount of protein that your star athlete needs.As a general rule, young athletes can meet their daily protein needs by making sure to include a source of lean protein such as eggs, milk, yogurt, nuts, nut butter, beans, lentils, tofu, chicken or fish at each meal and snack.""Eating a healthy diet ensures that an athlete is getting all the nutrients their body needs to produce energy and create new muscle tissue, enzymes and other cellular structures involved in energy metabolism,"" Wehrle explains. ""Proper nutrition can also help repair damage from training as well as everyday wear and tear, and keeps the body's muscles, bones, joints, tendons and organs functioning optimally.""Young athletes should be eating five or six balanced meals and snacks each day, and should be eating every three hours. Each meal should include a balance of complex carbs, lean protein, healthy fat, fruits and vegetables. Each snack should include a combination of all three macronutrients: complex carbs, lean proteins and healthy fats.If your athlete has any food allergies or intolerances, work with a registered dietitian to make sure they are appropriately filling any ""gaps"" in their diet created by eliminating foods or food groups.Wehrle recommends the following as healthy choices for young athletes:See more ideas for healthy snacks and lunches to fuel a young athlete's performance.Parents can encourage healthy eating behaviors in children by first modeling those desired behaviors. Children mimic the behaviors of the adults in their lives. Therefore, if you want your child to eat healthy, work to set a good example.Eat family meals together as often as possible. Parents are responsible for the what, when and where of eating, so do your part by planning healthy meals and snacks at set, regular meal and snack times. Encourage eating at the table as a family and not in front of the TV, while distracted or in the car. ""As long as parents do their part – the what, when and where of feeding – children are responsible for deciding how much to eat and whether or not to eat at all,"" Wehrle says.Make eating a pleasant and positive experience. Introduce new or healthy foods to your child in a fun and positive way and never nag children or make negative comments about a child's eating habits. This only makes things worse. ""Offer, but don't force,"" Wehrle says. ""The more you pressure your child to eat a certain food, the less likely your child will be to eat that food. On the other hand, the more you restrict certain foods, it's more likely your child will want that food.""The specially trained pediatric sports performance experts at Children's Health Andrews Institute Sports Performance powered by EXOS can help your young athlete perform at his or her best while remaining healthy and thriving.

299,https://diatribe.org/10-tips-teenagers-live-well-type-1-diabetes,"Share this ArticleRead more on:By Adam BrownTwitter Summary: @asbrown1 shares his top 10 tips for living w/ #T1D, straight from presentation to 100+ teens at #CWDFFL15 At the Children with Diabetes Friends For Life Conference this month, I had the incredible opportunity to speak to ~100 teenagers with diabetes. My talk, “10 Tips for Living Well with Type 1,” was a lot of fun to put together, and our team thought diaTribe readers might be interested in seeing it.I agonized over how to present this so that it wouldn’t come across as a lecture – even my  teenage self would not react well to some of the advice (“Sleep seven hours a night? Hah! I have sports plus exams plus the next level to beat in Halo 3!”). I concluded that the best thing I could do was make this session a conversation, but ground it in lessons I’ve learned over time. Thankfully, I also had the amazing FFL staff by my side to help guide the discussion.The session reminded me of something that I intuitively know but often forget: each person’s diabetes is completely different, and what works for me won’t work for everyone. And equally important, what works for me may change over time – it certainly has since I was a teenager. I’m sharing the slides below in case they’re useful, but my biggest hope is that it gets you thinking about your own diabetes. What motivates you? What drags you down? What can you do better today? Who can you reach out to for support? Let us what you think by email or on Twitter.           [The most painfully awkward picture I could find!]           As the oldest of six kids, I had a lot of responsibility from a young age, and my Mom was also a very hands-off parent; both helped me take the reins of my diabetes from an early age. I hope everyone can find the right balance between taking care of their own diabetes, but also relying on their parents for support when needed.            This is what I was told as a teenager – manage your diabetes or else you will have complications (eye damage, kidney damage, nerve damage). I couldn’t really wrap my head around this logic, since these long-term benefits felt too far off to matter. Consequently, my motivation to deal with diabetes was fairly low.            As a teenager, no one ever told me that there are short-term benefits to managing blood sugar, like having more energy for sports, doing better in school, or being a happier and more pleasant person to be around. I wish I had known that! This leads to tip #1 – the most important thing I would say to my teenage self.            Try to think of a compelling, immediate reason that in-range blood sugars benefit you. It will keep you motivated on those days when nothing seems to be going right. For me, better blood sugars give me more energy to live life; help me think more clearly at work (and thereby help more people with diabetes); and make me happier, less stressed, and more pleasant to be around.For the second tip, let’s move on to a useful analogy to think about measuring blood sugar. No one ever explained diabetes like this, but I think my teenage self would have found it useful.            Nope!            You can drive more safely when the windshield is clear!           Here’s the same analogy in diabetes form. I typically tested only 3-5 times per day as a teenager, just like driving a car with most of the windshield blacked out.           In college, I began testing more often, which gave me a lot more information about my glucose, and allowed me to correct things when I veered off course. I could see out the windshield a little bit better.            Getting on CGM was a total gamechanger for me – it was like seeing my diabetes in a movie for the first time, rather than isolated pictures a few times per day. A clear windshield!           This leads to tip #2: just as you wouldn’t drive a car without looking out the windshield, it’s hard to safely “drive” your diabetes without testing your blood sugar often.             Tip #3. I was told as a teenager that I could eat anything with diabetes, as long I took insulin for it. So I did. And I didn’t do very well in managing meals...This was the biggest diabetes mistake I made as a teenager: eating as if I didn’t have diabetes. It set me up for failure, since insulin just works too slowly to keep up with these foods; I didn’t test often enough to correct mistakes; and I couldn’t estimate carbs very well.                Asking these questions would have guided me towards different foods.           See my 10 Diet Commandments for more on this front. I recognize my way of eating isn’t for everyone, and my teenage self could not have coped with it. But even making one different food choice per day would have made a difference.            I was always active as a teenager, but living in suburban areas, I didn’t move around nearly enough outside of dedicated sports time in school. Fitbits weren’t around back then, but using one definitely would have pushed me to be more active in small ways. These are some of the principles I would recommend to anyone thinking about exercise – not all of them will apply to you, but hopefully one of these six can help you get more active. [See more on barriers to exercise here.]The big insulin mistake I made with exercise was suspending my pump, which always made me go high after exercise, and didn’t treat the immediate hypoglycemia. [More on managing BG during exercise is here.]           Tip #5. Two mistakes I made often as a teenager – overcorrecting lows and snacking directly out of the package. Both often exploded into out-of-range blood sugars later. I’ve figured out strategies to prevent these mistakes from happening: (i) having a routine low treatment (glucose tabs) that I won’t overeat, and (ii) pouring snacks into a bowl instead of eating directly from the package. What mistakes do you routinely make? Here’s an article for more on identifying your own “landmines.”           Take note when things go well and try to replicate what happened! I call these diabetes “bright spots.” For me, bright spots happen when I exercise in the morning, get enough sleep, and follow my diet commandments. What works for you?                     These questions are easy to ask in the moment, but often dragged me down.           I’ve found these types of questions to be more helpful.            See this article for more on asking productive questions.           No one ever told me that sleep affects my blood sugars. Following a night of poor sleep, I need about 24% more insulin and see much more variable blood sugars.I didn’t get much sleep as a teenager, but perhaps I would have gotten more if I had known what a difference it makes to my blood sugars, mood, and energy levels! Read more about my sleep experiment here.           This is how I so often felt in the mornings as a teenager – part of this stemmed from not sleeping long enough, and part probably stemmed from having high or low blood sugars over night. How amazing it would have been to have had CGM back then!                     Everyone learns differently, and what’s exciting is the vast number of ways out there to learn more about diabetes. Figure out how you like learning and what resources you find helpful: online, in person, forums, articles, videos, etc. Learning more about diabetes has made a tremendous difference in what I do on a daily basis.           Those around you have a tremendous impact on your diabetes – whether you realize it or not. My college roommate was a bodybuilder, and that had a profound influence on me. His discipline and dedication to eating well and exercising rubbed off in so many ways. I try to surround myself with people that support my diabetes – it has made a big difference (and still does)!            I’ve been lucky to travel all over the world with diabetes, including cycling trips, hiking in Peru, sailing in the Pacific Ocean, climbing mountains and volcanoes, and hiking on glaciers. It’s all possible with diabetes – I just needed to plan a little bit more.Don’t ever think you cannot do something with diabetes!diaTribe provides free cutting-edge diabetes insights and actionable tips for people with diabetes.Our mission is to help individuals better understand their diabetes and to make our readers happier and healthier.

Daily nutritional requirementsThe eating habits of teenagers are often rather strange, and teens take many nutritional risks. They may miss family meals and fill up on fast food; they may skip breakfast and experiment with meal supplements. Some girls cut calories to lose weight; some boys pack in calories to gain weight: In brief, they've turned a corner and realized that they can do whatever they want with their bodies. Page 1 of 4 - Learn why calcium is so important to a teens growing body on page 2The importance of calcium During adolescence, kids grow faster than at any time except infancy; in fact, half of their growth occurs in this period. They need calcium-rich foods,  such as dairy products, to help build strong, healthy bones. A calcium  deficit during childhood and adolescence might never be fully overcome  in later years. Reducing or eliminating milk products during this  all-important growth spurt could mean that your child will fail to reach  her growth potential and may contribute to her developing osteoporosis  in later life.Canada's Food Guide  to Healthy Eating recommends that youths aged ten through sixteen have 3  to 4 servings of milk products a day. After age sixteen, it's 2 to 4  servings. Examples of one serving are: 250 mL (one cup) of milk, 50 g (2  slices) of processed cheese, 50 g (1 in. x 1 in. x 3 in.) cube of  cheese, or 175 mL (3/4 cup) of yogurt or ice cream. A single serving of  milk packs a big nutritional punch: as much protein as a large Grade A  egg, almost as much potassium as a banana, 45 percent of the daily  requirement for vitamin D -- a total of 25 nutrients in all. Vitamin D  is essential to the proper absorption and utilization of calcium, which  is why milk is fortified with vitamin D.Are you kids addicted to cola?But in spite of this,  many teens start to snub milk and substitute cola for the milk they used  to drink. Some teens drink 2 L a day, as if addicted to cola. Caffeine  -- whether it's in cola, coffee,  or tea -- may increase one's excretion of calcium. If your teen drinks  cola instead of milk, his store of calcium is reduced both by not  consuming milk products and possibly by leaching the calcium out of his  body. Don't challenge the cola-crazy teen, but don't put cola on your  shopping list either. Pour a glass of milk for him at dinner. If he  doesn't drink it, try chocolate milk the next day; the nutrients from  milk are still there.  Page 2 of 4 -- Learn what your child should be eating on page 3.Ensuring your teen is eating wellStock your fridge with tubs of yogurt and your freezer with frozen yogurt and ice cream, ready for teens to grab when hunger strikes. Tuck individual servings of cheese, pudding, yogurt, or yogurt beverages into your teen's lunch bag.   Try the following ideas to increase your whole family's calcium intake: • Begin the day with a fruit frappé or milkshake. Make it ""to go"" if your teen is running late for school. •  Add a slice of cheese to a lunch sandwich. •  For an after-school snack, have fruit and a yogurt dip. •  Make hot chocolate (with milk) on frosty days. Make milkshakes on hot days. •  Dilute condensed soups with milk, not water. •  Crown casseroles with a bubbly cheese topping. •  Grate cheese over salads. •  Pour cheese sauce over steamed broccoli or cauliflower. •  Serve quiche, cheese soufflé, and cheesy pasta dishes often. •  Add skim-milk powder to meat loaf, mashed potatoes, casseroles, and baked goods. Just 15 ml. (I tbsp.) of skim-milk powder contains 70 mg of calcium. •  Serve a cheese tray with crackers and apple and pear slices as dessert. •  Make a milk dessert -•  pudding, tapioca, rice pudding, or baked custard. •  Use evaporated milk when baking. It has double the calcium of regular fresh milk.  Ironing out the differences A diet that's low in iron can lead to decreased immune function, loss of energy, and a reduced capacity for learning. It can also lead to iron-deficiency anemia, which is characterized by a pale complexion, listlessness, and irritability. During adolescence, the incidence of iron deficiency decreases in boys but increases in girls. Girls can be low in iron because of dieting; eating inadequate amounts of meat, poultry, and fish; and increased iron losses due to menstruation. Experts offer widely different estimates on the percentage (from 29 to 84 per cent) of young Canadian women who don't meet the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for iron.Meat, fish, and poultry contain heme iron (from animal blood), which is more easily absorbed and used by the body than the iron in vegetables and grains. However, heme iron and vitamin C enhance the body's ability to absorb the iron in grains and vegetables.   To increase your family's iron intake: •  Pick whole-grain cereals and iron-fortified cereals. Read the nutrition panel on the label, and check the amount of iron (sometimes identified as ferrous sulfate listed; choose ones that also have fibre -•  oatmeal is among the best. •  Choose whole-wheat breads to make school lunches. •  For an after-school snack, bake bran muffins chock full of raisins and dried apricots. •  Serve meat, fish, and poultry often. •  Add red kidney beans to casseroles.  Page 3 of 4 -- discover what your kids shouldn't be eating on page 4. Gradually reducing fatAdolescence is a step-down period from the higher-fat diet of childhood to the lower-fat diet of adults. Reduce the fat component of your meals gradually so that by the time your teens achieve their full growth potential, their fat intake includes the same lower-fat foods appropriate for the adults in the family.During their growth phases, many teens need the calories of higher-fat foods. As a concentrated source of calories, nutritious higher-fat foods such as peanut butter and cheese are particularly important to vegetarians, kids involved in sports, and teens who can't seem to find the time to eat. The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) has concluded that people should not eliminate or restrict foods that are nutritious just because of their fat content.This message from the CPS differs from that of the Committee of Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) which suggests that parents start cutting back on fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol for their children after the age of two. The CPS, however, cites cases of parents, overzealous in their reduction of fat intake, whose children have suffered delayed growth and delayed puberty because of the misapplication of dietary advice meant for adults, not children.Vitamin and mineral supplementsA study of over 200 kids aged eight to fifteen in Saskatoon revealed that 36 per cent take vitamin or mineral supplements. However, only 14 per cent consistently use the same supplement throughout the year. Beta-carotene may have been the rage last month. Now zinc's hot. Adolescence is a time to experiment, and the multi-billion-dollar supplement industry is ready to supply their desires.Teens who eat the number of servings recommended in Canada's Food Guide don't need vitamin and mineral supplements. But a daily supplement containing 100 per cent or less of the RNI of vitamins and minerals is usually safe. If your teen's meals are particularly erratic, it may even do a little good, but it won't substitute for the hundreds of nutrients supplied by a balanced diet of real foods.It's when kids self-prescribe individual vitamins that they can get into trouble. Supplements of a single nutrient may interfere with the absorption of other nutrients. For example, if he takes large doses of zinc over a prolonged period of time, your son could become deficient in iron and copper. As a general rule, the water-soluble vitamins B and C can be taken without major health hazards because you excrete the excess in your urine. But no vitamins, even the water-soluble ones, are safe in excess.What vitamin dosage?Help your teen determine if the dosage she's taking is within healthy limits. Ask her to consider consulting your doctor or a dietitian at the public health department. Diet books and infomercials offer a lot of contradictory and inaccurate information, so she needs help in selecting information from reputable sources. If your daughter has thrown caution to the wind and is consuming a cocktail of supplements, it's time to intervene-her health is at risk. Of particular concern are mega-doses (more than five times the recommended adult dose) of the following nutrients:- Vitamin A At 25,000 International Units (IU) a day, vitamin A can cause serious liver damage, hair loss, and bone and joint pain. If there's a chance your daughter may be or could become pregnant, more than 10,000 IU increases the risk of birth defects.- Vitamin D Prolonged use of 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day can cause nausea, high blood pressure, and kidney damage.- Niacin At 2,000 mg a day, niacin can cause an irregular heartbeat and liver damage. However, some people experience headaches, flushing, cramps, and nausea with just 50 mg a day.- Selenium Over 150 mcg a day of this antioxidant mineral may cause baldness and nail and tooth loss.Page 4 of 4Sign Up For Our Newsletters© 2021 TVA Group.

301,https://ndtv.in/health/weight-loss-tips-in-hindi-weight-loss-tips-in-hindi-for-girl-at-home-best-exercises-for-weight-loss-2113176,"The key to shedding pounds is choosing foods that fight hunger.If your child had a bagel for breakfast this morning, it wasn't much more nutritious than eating a bowl of sugar, says Parents advisor David Ludwig, MD, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Boston Children's Hospital. That's because most starchy carbohydrates, like bread, white rice, and potatoes, dissolve into glucose soon after you swallow them. Starting the day with eggs or another source of protein instead will not only help your child feel fuller, but it will help him lose weight.Dr. Ludwig is seriously worried about how many kids are getting fat -- the percentage of 6- to 11-year-olds who are overweight has doubled in the last 25 years. And the situation is only going to get worse: Children who are overweight are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, and could face kidney failure and amputations by age 30. Ironically, our focus on low-fat eating over the last decades -- and the subsequent boom in high-carb meals and snacks -- may be a key factor in the obesity epidemic, says Dr. Ludwig. But an Atkins-style low-carb diet isn't the answer either. In his eye-opening new book, Ending the Food Fight: Guide Your Child to a Healthy Weight in a Fast Food/Fake Food World, he offers a road map -- backed up by the latest scientific research -- for helping kids stay slim.The glycemic load is key. This is the measure of how quickly a food containing carbohydrates turns into glucose. Studies have shown that when a kid eats a high-glycemic meal, his blood-glucose surges and then plummets -- leaving him even hungrier. A low-glycemic meal takes longer to digest so a child's blood sugar stays steady, and he'll feel full longer. In general, low-glycemic carbs have more fiber and are less processed.Choose lots of veggies and fruits (but not all of them). No surprise here: You should pile on the produce. However, corn and potatoes have a high glycemic index, and certain tropical fruits, such as bananas and pineapple, are more likely to contribute to weight gain than apples, grapes, oranges, cantaloupe, kiwi, or berries.Try to include protein in most meals and snacks. In addition to being filling, protein stimulates the release of a hormone that helps the body release stored fat to use for energy, says Dr. Ludwig.Fat isn't always the enemy. Healthy fats like unsaturated oils, nut butters, and avocado slow down digestion, and they make fruit, veggies, and whole grains even more filling. Fat is actually vital to health: It's needed to make cell membranes throughout the body -- and the types of fat your child eats affect his immune system, nervous system, and overall health.Avoid foods that your great-grandparents couldn't have recognized. Fake foods (think chicken nuggets, fruit roll-ups, cheese puffs, and other highly processed products bearing no resemblance to anything found in nature) are rarely healthy choices, says Dr. Ludwig. When you choose grains, look for the least-processed options, such as stone-ground wheat bread, steel-cut oatmeal, and brown rice.Food can affect behavior, too. When your child's blood sugar drops soon after a high-glycemic meal, she also has a surge in the stress hormone adrenaline. That can make her cranky, irritable, or unable to focus in class.Kids don't have to feel deprived. No parent wants to put their child on a diet. But if the whole family focuses on low-glycemic eating, one child who has a weight problem won't feel singled out. By helping him focus on the quality of the food he's eating rather than the quantity, he can eat until he feels satisfied and still lose weight. For more information, go to endingthefoodfight.com.Shift the balance to carbs with a low- or medium-glycemic load, and cut back on ones that are high. Some examples:Parents Magazine

                More info.Obesity in children and adolescents is the new and emerging public health problem. Over the last few decades the number of children who are overweight or obese has doubled.The percentage of children aged 6–11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980 to nearly 18% in 2010. The percentage of teenagers aged 12–19 years who were obese increased from 5% to 18% over these three decades as well. In the United States, nearly one third of the child population was affected by obesity or was overweight in 2010.Some of the steps to curb obesity and overweight in children and adolescents include dietary changes.

Youth Fitness
Youth exercise professionals are in a powerful position to positively influence eating behaviors. This is when independence begins to be established with regard to food and beverage choices and meal preparation.Coaches and trainers - even Youth Sports Coaches - often serve as mentors to adolescents, so this population may be receptive to our messages about healthy eating. This can significantly affect well-being—in adolescence and throughout adulthood.Originally appeared in the Spring 2020 issue of American Fitness MagazineUnfortunately, the nutritional needs of adolescents are often overlooked, leaving them at risk for developing unhealthy behaviors. Many adolescents lack basic nutritional and culinary knowledge. If you are a certified nutrition coach and have the necessary training required to train youth, then this is a great opportunity to make a huge difference!Also, their mealtimes are often irregular—because of their busy schedules—and they frequently skip meals. Further, they face potentially negative influences from peers, media, personal food preferences and even family. Combined, these factors can easily lead to excessive consumption of nonnutritive foods (e.g., processed foods and sweetened beverages) along with an inadequate intake of essential nutrients.This is particularly problematic during this part of the life cycle because adolescent bodies are still growing and developing. As young people move through the stages of prepuberty, active puberty and postpuberty, they undergo specific physiological changes that require additional intake of certain vitamins and minerals.While some young clients may need specialized nutritional counseling and planning (see “A Few Words on Scope of Practice,” below), most will do well with guidance from coaches and trainers, who can offer simple ways to adopt healthier eating habits.Many fitness professionals work with clients in all stages of the life cycle. Here are a few nutritional challenges that are specific to preteens and adolescents:Energy. Energy needs vary tremendously during adolescence and can range from 1,600 to 3,000 calories per day, depending on factors such as physical activity level and current growth rate (Ellis 2019; Mangieri 2019). Like the onset of puberty, peak height-gain velocity occurs at different ages for different individuals. Typically, growth spurts in adolescent girls begin around 10 years of age and peak at about 12 (Sizer & Whitney 2020). Boys’ growth spurts begin at 12 and peak at about 14 years, finally slowing down around age 19 years (Sizer & Whitney 2020). Specific calorie intake guidelines (ordered by age and activity level) are shown in Table A2-1 in the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USDHHS & USDA 2015).Calcium and vitamin D. Calcium requirements are high during adolescence because of crucial bone development. For males and females ages 9–18, the Dietary Guidelines recommend an intake of 1,300 milligrams of calcium per day. Vitamin D also plays an essential role in supporting rapid bone growth and bone density. Dietary supplementation is often encouraged to ensure that adolescents meet the recommended 600 international units per day (USDHHS & USDA 2015). Unfortunately, sodas and other sugary beverages are often chosen over drinks fortified with calcium and vitamin D, such as nut or animal milk.Iron. Both male and female adolescents need greater amounts of iron to support an increase in blood volume and the development of lean body mass. Teen girls typically don’t consume as much iron as boys, despite their need to replace losses due to menstruation (Sizer & Whitney 2020). Specifically, males and females ages 9–13 need 8 mg per day, males ages 14–18 need 11 mg per day, and females ages 14–18 need 15 mg per day (USDHHS & USDA 2015).Fewer than 10% of adolescents eat enough fruits and vegetables. This puts youth at risk for problems associated with low dietary fiber and inadequate amounts of micronutrients. Also, 90% of people in this age group consume more than their recommended upper limit of sodium (2,300 mg/day) (CDC n.d.); that increases their risk for electrolyte imbalances. About 40% of adolescents’ daily calorie intake is in the form of “empty calories” from added sugars and fats, found in foods like fast food, pizza, soda and sweets (CDC 2019).This will not only increase the risk of overweight/obesity but can also lead to poor nutrition overall, as these foods often take the place of nutrient-dense foods. These factors help explain why teens are experiencing higher rates of overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, type 2 diabetes, and irritable bowel conditions (Chaffin 2019; CDC 2019).Adolescent clients will have diverse goals regarding sports, weight and health. Here are a few general strategies and sugges­tions for training clients in this age group:General health. Encourage adolescents to include foods from all food groups daily, including a variety of fruits and vegetables, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy oils.Weight. While weight loss requires a calorie deficit, adolescents must be careful to consume enough nourishment to support growth and prevent loss of muscle mass. Talk to them about limiting processed foods and controlling portions, and promote mindful eating (e.g., eating meals away from screens). Also recommend they avoid quick fixes like fad diets. Explain that “diet pills” may increase their risk for dehydration or toxicity and have generally not been safety-tested except in adults (NIH 2018).Sports and/or athletics. Adolescent athletes require more calories and other nutrients than their sedentary peers; however, nutrient needs will depend on the type, intensity and duration of training and competition. Explain this to your athletic clients. For example, if training is focused on building muscle strength and size, clients will need adequate amounts of both carbohydrate and protein to support new muscle growth, in addition to the bone development.The fitness professional can urge adolescents to follow eating behaviors that promote optimal health. For example:Encourage frequent mini meals and snacks. Eating three mini meals and two or three snacks each day will help adolescents meet their elevated energy needs. Suggest carrying a small cooler with portable items to consume on breaks throughout their day.Provide simple guidelines. For example, tell clients to eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables to get an array of nutrients. Also, explain that a well-balanced mini meal includes three things: a low-fat protein, a healthy (whole-grain) carbohydrate, and a serving of fruit or vegetables. Protein and fiber help with satiety between meals. Some possibilities:(Shield 2019)Offer a quick breakfast menu. Suggest easy combinations that won’t disrupt clients’ already-rushed morning routines. Recommend mini meals that are rich in iron, calcium and vitamin C. For instance:If clients shy away from veggies, suggest fortified foods. Encourage clients who shun nutrient-dense vegetables, such as dark leafy greens, to supplement their diets with foods fortified with iron, calcium and vitamin D. Whole-grain cereals and 100% juice are two examples.Involve family members when possible. Advise caregivers in charge of family mealtimes to include whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits and vegetables. Refer people to myplate.gov for sound nutritional advice. Also encourage keeping the house stocked with healthy choices for adolescent children and their friends.Pad your nutritional know-how by exploring more of our nutrition courses. The youths you train will thank you! When adolescents first come to you for training, their knowledge of nutrition will depend on school programs, family habits and other factors. It is important to meet young clients where they are and to give them the clarity they need to make independent decisions in the future. Taking a relatable approach when sharing information about healthy eating patterns will help adolescents to absorb it. (See “Screen Time: Use Tech to Promote Healthy Eating,” below, for a few ideas.) Remember: Nutrition education should be fun—for your clients and for you! Adequate fluid intake is vital at every age; however, adolescents often do not meet the standards set by the European Food Safety Authority. Here are a few suggestions to help young clients aim for optimal hydration:Be sure to keep your scope of practice in mind when working with adolescents. (This, of course, will differ among fitness professionals, some of whom are also registered dietitians or nutritionists.) Always refer adolescents to a registered dietitian or nutritionist if you feel further guidance is necessary or if an existing medical condition, including a food allergy or sensitivity, could affect nutritional status.As stated by the NASM Nutrition Certification textbook (chapter 2, page 5), “[If] any client has a change in health status, shows an unexplained drop or increase in weight, or shows signs or symptoms of a psychological disorder, the coach must not only recommend that his or her client consult with a professional, but also refuse further sessions until cleared by a licensed healthcare provider.”The NASM Nutrition Certification program offers an entire four-lesson chapter on the nutrition coach’s scope of practice.

307,https://www.realmomnutrition.com/help-your-teenager-with-picky-eating/,"Real Mom NutritionA no-judgments zone about feeding a family.Is your teenager stuck in her eating habits? Don’t give up! Here are 10 tips for helping your teenager with picky eating.Picky eating isn’t just something that affects young kids–and I say that from personal experience. I’m a former picky eater, and I know firsthand that extreme picky eating can eventually feel embarrassing and simply too inconvenient, which is powerful motivation to change (even if that means baby steps).  I’m a big fan of the book Helping Your Child With Extreme Picky Eating and recommend it often to parents. The authors have a new workbook called Conquer Picky Eating For Teens and Adults and they’re sharing their ten best tips in this post. If you have a picky teenager in your house (or you or your husband are picky eaters) I hope this advice helps you.by Katja Rowell and Jenny McGlothlinDon’t worry, this isn’t another article about sneaking spinach into brownies, calling broccoli “trees,” a “one bite rule”, or modeling healthy eating! You’ve probably read dozens of those articles over the years, a book or two about how French kids eat everything, maybe even taken your child to feeding therapies—but your teen is still stuck in their eating patterns. As feeding specialists, most of the parents we have worked with have spent years agonizing and strategizing around how to help their children eat more or different foods. By the time their children are teens, many have given up and mostly provide a handful of accepted foods. “We decided our relationship was more important than leafy greens, and none of what we tried helped anyway.” We think this prioritizing of the relationship with your teen is a good thing, but it doesn’t mean all hope is lost.While our work has mostly focused on helping parents of young children with picky eating, from typical to extreme, we realized there aren’t many resources for teens who want to explore eating more or different foods; so we wrote the workbook Conquer Picky Eating for Teens and Adults. While your teen will be taking charge of her eating, there are ways parents can still help. Here are ten tips to help your teen improve her relationship with food, support her appetite, address anxiety, feel empowered, stay connected, and learn to eat a wider variety:1. Think of your role as more facilitation than actively “helping.” We know, the article is about helping your teen, but tip one is about realizing that even subtle pressure or encouragement can undermine your teen’s confidence. If you consider what your teen is trying to accomplish and can provide the pieces that make their plan work, then you are facilitating and not pressuring.2. Help your teen connect to their motivation. Many teens are scared they can’t change or feel hopeless since they’ve “failed” feeding therapy or tried every “trick” in the book. Talk to them away from mealtime, if they are receptive. What is it about their eating that bothers them? Do they feel their eating limits what they can do? Do they want to go to prom and not order off the children’s menu? This kind of conversation may not be able to happen with you right now if you’ve had a lot of conflict around food over the years. In our book we empower teens to explore these issues of motivation and their history at their own pace. Sometimes taking parents out of the equation spurs progress.3. Listen to your teen if they want to talk, respect their silence if they don’t. Your teen needs to explore this process on their own time and in their own way. Help them fill out their food preferences list (they might not remember “foods they used to eat but don’t anymore”) or if they ask for your input, the sections on their early eating experience in the chapters on understanding why they eat the way they do. Try not to get defensive. We know you did the best you could, and we know that picky eating is complicated and there are many factors that contribute to why your teen eats the way they do. They might blame you—it’s what teens often do. Try not to take it personally. If you’re a regular reader of the Real Mom Nutrition blog, you know that what parents do matters, but it’s not the whole picture.4. Be good company at mealtimes. If you aren’t eating together, ask if they are ready to join you at mealtimes. If they say “no” let them know they are welcome to join you when they are ready. Try to ignore what or how much they are eating. Make the meal table a place to connect. Do try to be available for family meals if your teen is interested. Breakfast may be a great place to start, or weekend lunch. Be clear that there will be no pressure to eat any foods, that it’s about sharing mealtimes and making the table a place where you connect and spend time together. And… find things to do together that have nothing to do with food. Eating challenges can strain the parent-child relationship. If mealtimes are still too stressful, find things to do together twice a week that aren’t about food—maybe watch a Netflix show or go for a walk.5. Ask your teen to offer suggestions for shopping and meal planning. Put the list on the fridge or another open space and let them write in what they want. Try not to react if they ask you to purchase certain foods, such as canned fruit if you prefer fresh. Ask what your teen might enjoy eating along with pasta for example. Maybe have a pasta night where dishes are on the table family-style with plain pasta, a sauce on the side, some parmesan, and one or two veggie or fruit choices. Try to put a few things on the table they enjoy. Recognize that there will be food waste. They might ask you to buy a box of crackers and only eat a few. This is part of the process. Please try not to get after them for wasting food. (Chapter 17 in the book explores the idea of food waste and how to minimize it.)6. Support them when they are ready to explore. This might mean taking them to a cooking class, paying for an online class, or making a trip to the library to peruse cookbooks. Take them to Costco, Trader Joe’s or your local grocer to try samples while you shop. Stay available, but in the background. “I’m here if you want to talk about anything.” Don’t ask after every trip to the store if they found something they liked.7. Be careful of your expectations. Your teen has likely struggled with eating for a long time; healing these issues can take time as well. Some young people make rapid progress, but for others it might take weeks or months. Asking them every few days if they have tried a new food puts pressure on the process and might make them more likely to shut down. Also know that early progress is not about eating those leafy greens. Early progress may be your teen making time to eat meals at regular intervals, enjoying accepted foods more, and feeling less anxious eating out.8. Recognize that “healthy” is about way more than vegetables. Several chapters in our book help teens “reclaim” healthy. Health is about connection and love (loneliness has been linked to poor health), about moving their bodies in enjoyable ways, and about addressing stress and anxiety. With all the focus on vegetables and nutrition, many people miss major opportunities to make a real impact on their health. Help them pursue their interests or connect with volunteer opportunities. Help them stay connected to others. Teens who are picky may feel awkward eating out or at social gatherings where there is food. Part of this may mean fending off comments from others, planning ahead a bit around eating out or social gatherings, or learning to talk to peers to get their needs met.9. Help your teen access professional help if they need it. Anxiety is very common with persistent and extreme picky eating. If they need help with anxiety, talk with them and a school counselor or a doctor. There are books and online resources for anxiety that might be what they need to see progress, or help them access a therapist if necessary. Several eating disorder dietitians and therapists we know are working through the Conquer Picky Eating workbook with clients and on other skills.Click To Tweet10. Give them tools. Teens are working on independence. We wrote our book to empower teens and young adults to make peace with food, support appetite and if they choose to, expand the variety they eat. With over 40 exercises and experiments, this book puts the reader in control of the process. Even bringing up the topic can be touchy, and certainly giving them a book might be met with an eye-roll, so we asked an eating disorder therapist to help us with some advice on how to give this book to your teen.As parents, we want what’s best for our children, and we want it as quickly as possible! Your teen will be working on ingrained feelings and preferences around food built over years and thousands of experiences. It’s not easy to make changes. You may also need to examine and address how you interact with your teen around food. If your teen isn’t ready or interested in changing their eating at this time, consider learning more yourself and keeping that door open. Mealtime Hostage blog and this private Facebook parent support group are great for parents looking for support, understanding, and resources.Selective eating is rarely an emergency. Accepting how your teens eats now, and being open to helping them in ways they identify along the way, can lead to real transformation.Note: If your teen is losing weight or experiencing concerning symptoms that may be due to poor nutrition, or anxiety is impacting their ability to go about typical teen tasks, please find additional help. Dieting or body image dissatisfaction can indicate more severe disordered eating. Start with your teen’s doctor or reach out for help.

Youth Fitness





Reading Time: 5 minutes 25 secondsYes, kids can handle - and even benefit from - weightlifting and plyometrics. But if you get a pit in your stomach when you see a nine year old walk into your gym, read this to learn how you can help kids strength-train safely.As a trainer, as a parent, or as both, you may hear questions and statements like these:“Kids can’t do strength training; they’ll get injured.”“Won’t too much fitness training stunt my kid’s growth?”“How can I safely help my kid train to be better at soccer?”Yes, while strength training can be dangerous for children if not done properly, here’s the truth:Kids can strength train.And they can benefit from it.Don’t stop reading this article until you’ve seen the science and learned the techniques to keep kids safe when you’re training them.  (At end of article, you can also share the infographic of 12 exercises for kids as a starting point toward strength training).Fitness is important, but it also needs to be age-appropriate. The latest research tells us that strength training is not only NOT dangerous for kids, it’s actually good for them if done properly.But wait, you can’t start a five-year-old out with a twenty-pound clean and press, right?Training for kids is only safe and beneficial when it’s age-appropriate, when it’s progressive, and when they’re taught and monitored for correct form.With childhood obesity on the rise, youth training programs have become increasingly widespread and popular. You need to know what to recommend to parents who want to get their kids started in fitness or conditioned for a sports team.  Just as adults need to build a foundation for strength training with exercises in balance and proper form and movement, children also require practice and strategies that match their age and fitness levels.A 2015 study by Lloyd et al describes a plan known as the Composite Youth Model, which provides an appropriate progression of skills specific to foundational motor skills, muscular strength, psychomotor ability, and sport specific skills for kids beginning at age two.In this earliest phase, children are just learning fundamental motor skills and building the neuromuscular pathways they need to coordinate movements. The simplest exercises are appropriate at this age, for example, bouncing a balloon from one hand to the next. Also important at this age is making movement and exercise a positive and social experience.During the middle phase, children should be introduced to multiple sports and activities. Placing emphasis on just one might be tempting, but it can lead to burnout, boredom, and repetitive motion injuries. This is the time to teach kids fundamental skills for movement, agility, strength, endurance, and hypertrophy, as well as specific sports skills. This is when you can start basic strength training.In the third phase, teens can get into more advanced strength and conditioning training, but focus should also be placed on socializing, building self-esteem, and developing a regular and consistent workout or sports routine. Emphasizing the importance of regular activity develops an attitude that will carry over into adulthood and prepare teens to live active and healthy lifestyles. It is crucial to remember that a one-size-fits-all approach cannot be used with children because in any age group there will be different talents, abilities and maturation rates.Here’s what the experts say.Kids don’t need to be lifting weights or learning any complicated moves before age 5.But during Phase 2, you can start to introduce strength training and other more targeted exercises to improve conditioning, movement, and overall fitness.Studies support this...In one study, researchers introduced boys between the ages of 10 and 12 to progressive, Olympic-style lifting, including clean and snatch, as well as basic plyometric exercises. A control group of boys did more traditional resistance training like bench pressing and squats. They were given fitness tests before starting the experimental exercises and several weeks after.What they found:The boys who did lifting and plyometric exercises showed significant improvement in fitness tests such as a countermovement jump, horizontal jump, balance, and 20-meter sprint, as compared to those who did resistance training only.In a second study, a group of eight- and nine-year-old soccer players were put through strength training and high-intensity conditioning a couple times a week in addition to soccer practice; this included squat jumps, weighted jumps, and sprints. The control group added more training, too - but their additional training was just more time spent on their usual soccer-specific training.What they found:All of the boys were tested before starting the new routine and several weeks after. Those doing weights and intense conditioning showed significant improvement compared to the control group. They were more flexible, could jump higher, had increased power, and showed greater endurance.IMPORTANT: Strength training, weight lifting, intense conditioning, and plyometric exercises can benefit children, but it must be done progressively and with proper instruction. The children in these studies were taught proper form, started out lifting light bars only, and were always monitored.Kids can’t and shouldn’t do the same workouts full-grown adults do. The primary goal is to keep the repetitions higher and sets lower to first create muscle memory.This ensures that kids develop proper form. Only when a child has the form down should you add weight and additional sets.When you have a child lifting with good form, you can determine an appropriate weight by testing increasing weights with ten repetitions.When the child starts to lose form or can’t complete ten reps, you have gone too high and need to step down to a lower weight.In study 1, described above, the children were given small increases in weight for ten reps. Once they mastered ten reps, they moved on to two sets of ten reps. Next they were given a varied set and rep scheme, up to three total sets. That pattern proved to be safe and slowly progressive.Research has proven kids can train safely and that doing so improves certain fitness measures.But do we really need to train kids this way?Why not just stick with playing sports and having fun?Yes, it will take more time and effort to teach a child to properly do Olympic-style lifts and plyometric moves, but the benefits are worth it. Here are just 4 of them:Intense training can make kids better at sports, but that’s not the only reason to do it.Weight lifting, plyometrics and conditioning are good for adults and kids alike. It makes us fitter and healthier. Never fear a client with a child again!So the word is in: You can and should do strength training and more complicated workouts with kids. Whether it’s your own children or your young clients, you can now bring better, more focused fitness into their lives. Just remember to do it safely.As a start, learn and print out or show these plyometrics, Olympic-style weightlifting, and resistance training moves as well as the seven tips for safely strength-training children, pre-teen and teen clients.  If you're interested in learning more about youth fitness, check out the ISSA’s certification program.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder. The symptoms include very low weight, a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight.This serious mental illness is most common in women and usually starts in adolescence. It is the third most common chronic illness in girls and young women and affects up to 1 in 200 girls. One in 11 people who develop anorexia after puberty are male.People with anorexia nervosa may see themselves as being heavy or large when they are actually severely underweight. They follow restrictive diets and harsh, punishing exercise routines. They control food as a way of controlling areas of their lives or dealing with negative emotions.Anorexia falls into 2 general types:People with this type of anorexia nervosa place severe restrictions on the quantity and type of food they consume.This could include counting calories, skipping meals, restricting certain foods (such as carbohydrates) and following obsessive rules, such as only eating foods of a certain colour.These behaviours may be accompanied by excessive exercise.People with this type of anorexia also place restrictions on the food they eat. But this is accompanied by binge eating and then purging.Binge eating means someone eats a large amount of food to cope with feelings of being out of control. The person then 'compensates' for this eating by purging the food through vomiting or misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas.The most obvious sign that someone has anorexia nervosa is that they are severely underweight, they have lost weight very quickly, or their weight fluctuates dramatically.A BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight. But being very thin is not the only sign of anorexia. There are also other signs that a person may have anorexia nervosa.The causes of anorexia nervosa are not fully understood.There may be genetic risk factors and a combination of environmental, social and cultural factors. It's likely that some people are more vulnerable to anorexia because of particular personality traits.The causes that may contribute to a person developing anorexia nervosa include:Psychological factors, such as a high level of perfectionism or obsessive-compulsive personality traits, feeling limited control in life and low self-esteem, a tendency towards depression and anxiety and a poor reaction to stress.Environmental factors, including the onset of puberty, stressful life events and relationship problems.Cultural pressures to be thin stemming from media and pop culture such as magazines, TV shows and movies.Occupations that demand a thin physique may increase the risk of anorexia nervosa, such as certain sports, ballet, or the television and fashion industries.Brain chemistry, because extreme dieting can affect the balance of hormones in the body, affecting how the brain functions.Genetic predisposition, which arises from the genes inherited from parents. Anorexia nervosa often runs in families, suggesting there may be a genetic cause.Many people with anorexia nervosa think they’re not sick enough or thin enough to need treatment. But seriously restricting calorie intake is dangerous and can have a serious impact on health. If you have anorexia nervosa, the earlier you seek help, the better your chances of recovery.If you are worried about your eating, it’s important to speak someone. Your doctor is a good place to start, or you could talk to someone you trust like a friend, family member or teacher. They will help you take the first steps towards treatment and recovery.FIND A HEALTH SERVICE — Our Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.ASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use our Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.After ruling out that weight loss is caused by another condition, your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional. This health professional will diagnose anorexia nervosa based on your thoughts, feelings and eating behaviours. They will also check for any other mental or physical complications.The first step to recovery is restoring good nutrition and a healthy weight. This allows treatments to work effectively. If the person has life threatening medical complications or is extremely low weight, they may need to spend time in hospital.A psychologist can help a person with anorexia nervosa learn behaviours that will help them to return to and maintain a healthy weight. Someone with anorexia nervosa may also see a dietitian, family therapist, psychiatrist or other members of a healthcare team.Antidepressants and other medicines are sometimes used to treat anorexia nervosa along with psychological therapy.On average, people have anorexia nervosa for 5 to 7 years. It's common for people with the condition to relapse, so follow-up and treatment for anorexia nervosa is important.When people with anorexia nervosa enter a state of starvation, their brain stops functioning properly. They are at risk of self-harm, substance abuse, suicide attempts, depression and anxiety.Anorexia nervosa can also cause physical complications including:Unfortunately, around 1 in 5 people eventually die of the consequences of anorexia nervosa, and one in 5 will attempt suicide.Learn more here about the development and quality assurance of healthdirect content.Last reviewed: July 2020These trusted information partners have more on this topic.Top resultsAnorexia nervosa (AN) is defined by the persistent restriction of energy intake, intense fear of gaining weight and disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape Read more on NEDC - National Eating Disorders Collaboration websiteAnorexia is a serious, potentially life threatening mental illness.

319,https://examples.yourdictionary.com/hasty-generalization-examples-and-how-to-avoid-them.html,"A hasty generalization occurs when someone generalizes an experience from examples, not evidence. Also known as hasty induction or overextension, a hasty generalization is a form of jumping to a conclusion. It is an informal fallacy that can lead to misinformation and stereotypes. Here are some common and well-known examples of hasty generalizations.People often rely on their own experiences to make future decisions. But, using anecdotes as evidence can lead to hasty generalizations, since a personal situation does not always represent or define a broader reality.For example, someone who had a rare allergic reaction to a medicine may advise others not to use that medication. In truth, the medicine might only be dangerous to that one person.When you see happy, smiling faces all over your social media feed, it’s easy to assume that their lives are fully content. But, the only sample you have is a few photos and status updates – not nearly enough evidence to understand the complexities of a person’s life. The curated version of themselves that they post on social media may not fully represent their day-to-day life.When a teacher doesn’t know who broke a classroom rule, they are tempted to punish the entire class. Beware of this hasty generalization! Those not guilty of the crime are often disproportionately affected by collective punishment. Just because one student misbehaves doesn’t mean the whole class should suffer.Every news publication gets a story wrong from time to time. In today’s reality, one incorrect story can overshadow years of journalistic integrity as readers (and often, President Trump himself) dismiss an entire news organization as “fake news.” It’s why journalists try to verify every source and avoid errors in their reporting.After Japanese forces bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States government feared possible espionage from those with Japanese ancestry. Executive Order 9066 authorized the removal and internment of 120,000 Japanese immigrants and Japanese-American citizens. The hasty generalization affected generations of Japanese and Japenese-American families. It was not overturned until 1976.Polling is an integral part of a political campaign. However, modern technology has caused phone polls to become victims of the hasty generalization fallacy. Pollsters typically conduct political surveys on landline phones, which are overwhelmingly owned by older voters. What’s more, they often receive inaccurate results due to a small sample size that may not be fully representative of all voters.Doctors often rely on their own expertise and experiences when diagnosing patients. But, in the last 30 years, doctors have overdiagnosed ADD and ADHD after making generalizations that have more to do with age, sex, maturity, and other conditions that mimic attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).If Romeo had waited just one more minute, would he and Juliet have avoided their untimely demise? Dramatic irony dictates the ending of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, but Romeo’s hasty generalization of Juliet’s death could have used a little more evidence before jumping to that conclusion.You’ve heard commercials claim that a select sample of professionals recommend a product. But without revealing how many people were really included -- and how they were chosen -- in the survey sample, this advertising tactic is just a hasty generalization. Weight loss ads are the pioneers of the “I did it, and so can you!” ploy. Besides being an excellent example of ethos, weight loss ads are convincing because they portray a happy and healthy individual enjoying the fruits of their success. But look at the fine print: is this the typical result for the weight loss product? Did a larger sample size lose a smaller amount of weight?Statistics show that teenage boys are twice as likely to cause a car accident than teenage girls. Automobile insurance companies jump to the conclusion that every teenage boy is a higher risk, no matter how safely he drives, and charge male drivers under 25 a higher premium.It’s important to recognize a hasty generalization when you hear one. Absolute words such as “always” or “everyone” are often found in hasty generalizations. Substitute these words with “sometimes” or “some people.” Also, consider checking more than one source when deciding if an argument is convincing. One person’s experience shouldn’t be enough to determine a group’s behavior.Knowing how to identify and use rhetorical devices is a great skill, but identifying fallacies can get you quite far in an argument. If you’d like to learn more about the different types of logical fallacies, check out some examples of common formal and informal fallacies.M.Ed. Education",6.33,9.79,3.11,9.53,2.89,742
